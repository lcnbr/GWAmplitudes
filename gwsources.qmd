# Gravitational Wave Generation {#sec-gwgen}


We start by looking at where and how (?s:gw) are generated. We will see that (?:gr) predicts the existence of (?s:gw), and we will explore under what conditions they are observable.

## Homogeneous solutions

 The first step is to consider the homogeneous solution, as all solutions will involve these terms. Setting $\SEco=0$ or $\srcco=0$ yields the wave equation in the absence of sources,
$$
   \SRDA \weakmet = 0 .
$${#eq-homogenous}

The De-Donder gauge (@eq-dedonder) and the remaining gauge freedom ^[Associated to changes in coordinates of the form $\ct{x}\to\ct{x}+\ct{\xi}$ with $\SRDA\ct{\xi}=0$.] restricts the possible forms of this solution to having only helicity $\pm2$ physically significant components (see @Weinberg:1972). Let us look at generic forms of the solution. The metric $\weakmet$ ought to be real-valued, thus we seek real solutions of the form

$$
    \weakmet = \polco \exp{\im k\cdot x} + \conjpolco \exp{-\im k\cdot x},
$$ {#eq-solutiongeneric}

where $\polco$ is the polarization tensor, $k$ is the wave vector and we define: $k\cdot x\equiv \mink \ct{k} \ct[\nu]{k} = \co{k} \ct{x}$. The polarization tensor is a symmetric rank-2 tensor, since $\weakmet$ is. Substituting @eq-solutiongeneric into $\SRDA\weakmet=0$ gives $\co{k} \ct{k} \equiv k^2=0$.^[Assuming non-zero perturbation $\weakmet$ of course.] ^[This is saying that the wavevector for the wave is null, thus that the wave propagates at the speed of light.] From @eq-dedonder we have
$$
    \polmix \co{k} = \frac{1}{2}\trpol k_\nu.
$${#eq-polk}
As said at the beginning of this subsection, we still have some remaining gauge freedom, which we now fix, choosing the following coordinate change $\ct{x}\to\ct{x}+\ct{\zeta}$ where:
$$
\ct{\zeta}=\im \ct{A} \exp{\im k\cdot x}    =  - \im \ct{\conj{A}} \exp{ -\im k\cdot x}
$$


In the new coordinates, the tensor perturbation takes the form:


$$
\weakTensor'_{\mu\nu}=\weakmet-\pdv{\co{\zeta}}{\ct[\nu]{x}}-\pdv{\co[\nu]{\zeta}}{\ct{x}}=\polTensor'_{\mu\nu} \exp{\im k\cdot x} + \polTensor^{\prime\ast}{}_{\mu\nu} \exp{-\im k\cdot x}.
$$

with 

$$
\polTensor'_{\mu\nu} = \polco + \co{k}\co[\nu]{A} + \co[\nu]{k}\co{A}
$$ {#eq-polTprime}

Equations -@eq-polk and -@eq-polTprime reduce the free components in the polarisation tensor to just two. Additionally, these equations conspire to yield a traceless polarisation tensor $\trpol=0$, with $\polco[0\mu]=0$ (see @Carroll:2019). This in turn implies that the metric perturbation itself is traceless, and thus becomes equal to its trace-reversed counterpart. This is the so-called transverse traceless gauge:

$$
\weakmet[0\mu]=0,\quad \trweakmet=0, \quad \ipdv[^]{\weakmet}{\nu}=0.
$$

The metric perturbation in this gauge is written as:  $\weakTTmet$. 

## Inhomogeneous solutions

With the homogeneous part of @eq-linearized accounted for, we are now ready to derive the inhomogeneous part. The solution of @eq-linearized in the presence of a source term will be heavily inspired by the analogous problem in electromagnetism, where one learns that any linear differential equation:

$$\mathcal{\hat{L}}\phi=J$$

is solved using green's functions. If we define the following retarded Green's function

$$
    \greens{\ct{x}-\ct{x'}} = -2\pi\,\deltafn{({x}-{x'})^2}\thetafn{t>t^{\prime}},
$$

which satisfies,

$$
    \SRDA\greens{\ct{x}-\ct{x'}} = -2\pi \deltafn[4]{\ct{x}-\ct{x'}}.
$$

Then, the solution to 

$$
 \SRDA \weakmet =  -16 \pi \grav \srcco
$${#eq-EFEwave}

is given by

$$
    \weakmet(x) = 8G\int\dd[4]{x'}\,\greens{\ct{x}-\ct{x'}}\srcco(x').
$$ {#eq-hsolInhom}

::: {.column-margin}
One gets the parallel solution to the trace reversed equation @eq-linearizedTR by swapping $\srcTensor$ with $\SETensor$ and all $\weakTensor$ with $\weakTRTensor$.
:::

Indeed, plugging in @eq-hsolInhom into @eq-EFEwave,
$$
    \Box_x\weakmet = 8\grav\int\dd[4]{x'}\pa[\big]{(\underbrace{\Box_x\greens{\ct{x}-\ct{x'}}}_{=-2\pi\,\deltafn{\ct{x}-\ct{x'}}}} \srcco(x') = -16\pi \grav\srcco(x).
$$
We can perform the $x^{\prime0}=t'$ integration in @eq-hsolInhom, with the Dirac delta function, which sets $t'$ to be the retarded time, $t'=t-\abs{\ct{x}-\ct{x'}}= t_r$,  i.e:
$$
\weakmet(x) = 8\grav\int\dd[3]{\tv{y}}\srcco(t,\tv{y})\dd{t'}\frac{\delta(t'-(t-\abs{\tv{x}-\tv{y}}))}{2\abs{\tv{x}-\tv{y}}} 
$$
    
$$
\weakmet(\tv{x},t) = 4\grav\int\dd[3]{\tv{y}}\frac{\srcco(t-\abs{\tv{x}-\tv{y}},\tv{y})}{\abs{\tv{x}-\tv{y}}}.
$${#eq-solInhomt}

We can interpret  $\weakmet(\tv{x},t)$, as the perturbation obtained by summing up all the radiation from point-sources located at $(\tv{x}-\tv{y},t_r)$ on the past light cone. Put differently $\weakmet(\tv{x},t)$ is the gravitational radiation produced by the source $\srcco$. Additionally, the form of the time argument of the source tensor, imposed by the definition of the Green's function, shows that the radiation propagates with velocity  $=1=c$. The solution given by @eq-solInhomt satisfies the harmonic coordinate condition of @eq-linearized, since

$$
    \covd{\SEco}{\mu}=0\ \Rightarrow\ \ipdv{\SEco}{\mu}+\underbracket{\Gamma\,\Gamma\,}_{\mathclap{\mathrm{non-linear}}}=0\ \Rightarrow\ \ipdv{\SEco}{\mu}=0,
$$

where we have ignored the non-linear terms encoded in the Levi-Civita connections. Then, 

$$
    \ipdv{\srcct}{\mu} = \partial_\mu\left(\SEco-\frac{\invmink[\mu\nu]}{2}\trSE\right) = -\frac{\invmink[\mu\nu]}{2}\ipdv{\trSE}{\mu}.
$$

Also

$$
    \trsrc[\mu] = \trSE[\mu] -\frac{\kron[_\mu^\mu]}{2}\trSE = -\trSE.
$$

Thus

$$
\begin{split}
    \ipdv{\srcct}{\mu} &= \frac{1}{2}\ipdv{\trsrc}{\mu}\invmink[\mu\nu] \\
    \ipdv{\srcmix}{\mu} &= \frac{1}{2}\ipdv{\trsrc}{\nu}.
\end{split}
$$

Then

$$
\begin{split}
    \ipdv{\mixweakmet}{\mu} &= 8\grav\pdv{} {\ct{x}} \int\dd[4]{x'} \greens{\ct{x}-\ct{x'}} \srcmix (x') \\
&= 8\grav\int\dd[4]{x'}\,\pdv{\greens{\ct{x}-\ct{x'}}}{ \ct{x}} \srcmix(x') \\
&= -8\grav\int\dd[4]{x'}\pdv{\greens{\ct{x}-\ct{x'}}}{\ct{x'}}\srcmix(x') \\
    &= \underbrace{8\grav\greens{\ct{x}-\ct{x'}}\srcmix(x')}_{=0\ \mathrm{at the boundary}} + 8G\int\dd[4]{x'}\,\greens{\ct{x}-\ct{x'}}\pdv{\srcmix(x')}{\ct{x'}} \\
    &= 8G\int\dd[4]{x'}\,\greens{\ct{x}-\ct{x'}} \frac{1}{2}\pdv{\trsrc(x')}{\ct{x'}} \\
    &=\quad \dots \quad \text{repeat in reverse} \\
    &= \pdv{} {\ct{x}} \brk[\Big]{8\grav\int\dd[4]{x'}\,\greens{\ct{x}-\ct{x'}} \frac{1}{2}\trsrc(x')} \\
    &= \frac{1}{2} \ipdv{\trweakmet}{\mu}.\checkmark
\end{split}
