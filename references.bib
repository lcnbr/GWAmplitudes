  author = {Jakobsen, Gustav Uhre and Mogull, Gustav},
  year = {2022},
  abstract = {Using the spinning worldline quantum field theory formalism we calculate the quadratic-in-spin momentum impulse {$\increment$}p{$\mu$}i and spin kick {$\increment$}a {$\mu$} i from a scattering of two arbitrarily oriented spinning massive bodies (black holes or neutron stars) in a weak gravitational background up to third postMinkowskian (PM) order (G). Two-loop Feynman integrals are performed in the potential region, yielding conservative results. For spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum we find a conservative scattering angle that is fully consistent with state-of-the-art post-Newtonian results. Using the 2PM radiated angular momentum previously obtained by Plefka, Steinhoff and the present authors we generalize the angle to include radiation-reaction effects, in which case it avoids divergences in the high-energy limit.},

  abstract = {We report the observation of a compact binary coalescence involving a 22.2\textendash 24.3 M\_{$\odot$} black hole and a compact object with a mass of 2.50\textendash 2.67 M\_{$\odot$} (all measurements quoted at the 90\% credible level). The gravitational-wave signal, GW190814, was observed during LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run on 2019 August 14 at 21:10:39 UTC and has a signal-to-noise ratio of 25 in the three-detector network. The source was localized to 18.5 deg{$^2$} at a distance of 241\_(-45)\^(+41) Mpc; no electromagnetic counterpart has been confirmed to date. The source has the most unequal mass ratio yet measured with gravitational waves, 0.112\_(-0.009)\^(+0.008), and its secondary component is either the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system. The dimensionless spin of the primary black hole is tightly constrained to {$\leq$} 0.07. Tests of general relativity reveal no measurable deviations from the theory, and its prediction of higher-multipole emission is confirmed at high confidence. We estimate a merger rate density of 1\textendash 23 Gpc{$^{-3}$} yr{$^{-1}$} for the new class of binary coalescence sources that GW190814 represents. Astrophysical models predict that binaries with mass ratios similar to this event can form through several channels, but are unlikely to have formed in globular clusters. However, the combination of mass ratio, component masses, and the inferred merger rate for this event challenges all current models of the formation and mass distribution of compact-object binaries.},

  abstract = {We summarize our current understanding of gravitational wave emission from core-collapse supernovae. We review the established results from multi-dimensional simulations and, wherever possible, provide back-of-the-envelope calculations to highlight the underlying physical principles. The gravitational waves are predominantly emitted by protoneutron star oscillations. In slowly rotating cases, which represent the most common type of the supernovae, the oscillations are excited by multi-dimensional hydrodynamic instabilities, while in rare rapidly rotating cases, the protoneutron star is born with an oblate deformation due to the centrifugal force. The gravitational wave signal may be marginally visible with current detectors for a source within our galaxy, while future third-generation instruments will enable more robust and detailed observations. The rapidly rotating models that develop non-axisymmetric instabilities may be visible up to a megaparsec distance with the third-generation detectors. Finally, we discuss strategies for multi-messenger observations of supernovae.},

  abstract = {Using the multivariate residue calculus of Leray, we give a precise definition of the notion of a cut Feynman integral in dimensional regularization, as a residue evaluated on the variety where some of the propagators are put on shell. These are naturally associated to Landau singularities of the first type. Focusing on the one-loop case, we give an explicit parametrization to compute such cut integrals, with which we study some of their properties and list explicit results for maximal and next-to-maximal cuts. By analyzing homology groups, we show that cut integrals associated to Landau singularities of the second type are specific combinations of the usual cut integrals, and we obtain linear relations among different cuts of the same integral. We also show that all one-loop Feynman integrals and their cuts belong to the same class of functions, which can be written as parametric integrals.},

  abstract = {We study the effect of cubic and tidal interactions on the spectrum of gravitational waves emitted in the inspiral phase of the merger of two non-spinning objects. There are two independent parity-even cubic interaction terms, which we take to be \$I\_1 = \{R\^\{\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash beta\}\}\_\{\textbackslash mu \textbackslash nu\} \{R\^\{\textbackslash mu \textbackslash nu\}\}\_\{\textbackslash rho \textbackslash sigma\} \{R\^\{\textbackslash rho \textbackslash sigma\}\}\_\{\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash beta\}\$ and \$G\_3 = I\_1-2 R\^\{\textbackslash alpha\}\textbackslash,\_\{\textbackslash mu\}\textbackslash,\^\{\textbackslash beta\}\textbackslash,\_\{\textbackslash nu\} R\^\{\textbackslash mu\}\textbackslash,\_\{\textbackslash rho\}\textbackslash,\^\{\textbackslash nu\}\textbackslash,\_\{\textbackslash sigma\} R\^\{\textbackslash rho\}\textbackslash,\_\{\textbackslash alpha\}\textbackslash,\^\{\textbackslash sigma\}\textbackslash,\_\{\textbackslash beta\}\$. The latter has vanishing pure graviton amplitudes but modifies mixed scalar/graviton amplitudes which are crucial for our study. Working in an effective field theory set-up, we compute the modifications to the quadrupole moment due to \$I\_1\$, \$G\_3\$ and tidal interactions, from which we obtain the power of gravitational waves radiated in the process to first order in the perturbations and leading order in the post-Minkowskian expansion. The \$I\_1\$ predictions are novel, and we find that our results for \$G\_3\$ are related to the known quadrupole corrections arising from tidal perturbations, although the physical origin of the \$G\_3\$ coupling is unrelated to the finite-size effects underlying tidal interactions. We show this by recomputing such tidal corrections and by presenting an explicit field redefinition. In the post-Newtonian expansion our results are complete at leading order, which for the gravitational-wave flux is 5PN for \$G\_3\$ and tidal interactions, and 6PN for \$I\_1\$. Finally, we compute the corresponding modifications to the waveforms.},

  abstract = {The eikonal approximation is an ideal tool to extract classical observables in gauge theory and gravity directly from scattering amplitudes. Here we consider effective theories of gravity where in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert term we include non-minimal couplings of the type \$R\^3\$, \$R\^4\$ and \$FFR\$. In particular, we study the scattering of gravitons and photons of frequency \$\textbackslash omega\$ off heavy scalars of mass \$m\$ in the limit \$m\textbackslash gg \textbackslash omega \textbackslash gg |\textbackslash vec\{q\}\textbackslash,|\$, where \$\textbackslash vec\{q\}\$ is the momentum transfer. The presence of non-minimal couplings induces helicity-flip processes which survive the eikonal limit, thereby promoting the eikonal phase to an eikonal phase matrix. We obtain the latter from the relevant two-to-two helicity amplitudes that we compute up to one-loop order, and confirm that the leading-order terms in \$\textbackslash omega\$ exponentiate \textbackslash `\{a\} la Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano. From the eigenvalues of the eikonal phase matrix we then extract two physical observables, to 2PM order: the classical deflection angle and Shapiro time delay/advance. Whenever the classical expectation of helicity conservation of the massless scattered particle is violated, i.e. the eigenvalues of the eikonal matrix are non-degenerate, causality violation due to time advance is a generic possibility for small impact parameter. We show that for graviton scattering in the \$R\^4\$ and \$FFR\$ theories, time advance is circumvented if the couplings of these interactions satisfy certain positivity conditions, while it is unavoidable for graviton scattering in the \$R\^3\$ theory and photon scattering in the \$FFR\$ theory. The scattering processes we consider mimic the deflection of photons and gravitons off spinless heavy objects such as black\textasciitilde holes.},

Because of the large mass ratio, we call these sources extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In a similar manner, COs can be captured by intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters or dwarf galaxies. The mass ratio in this case is lower, and hence we refer to the system as an intermediate-mass ratio inspiral (IMRI). Also, sub-stellar objects such as a brown dwarf, with masses much lighter than our Sun, can inspiral into supermassive black holes such as Sgr A* at our Galactic Centre. In this case, the mass ratio is extremely large, and hence, we call this system extremely large mass ratio inspirals (XMRIs). All of these sources of gravitational waves will provide us with a collection of snapshots of spacetime around a supermassive black hole that will allow us to do a direct mapping of warped spacetime around the supermassive black hole, a live cartography of gravity in this extreme gravity regime. E/I/XMRIs will be detected by the future space-borne observatories like LISA. There has not been any other probe conceived, planned, or even thought of ever that can do the science that we can do with these inspirals. We will discuss them from a viewpoint of relativistic astrophysics.},

  abstract = {Advanced methods for computing perturbative, quantum-gravitational scattering amplitudes show great promise for improving our knowledge of classical gravitational dynamics. This is especially true in the weak-field and arbitrary-speed (post-Minkowskian, PM) regime, where the conservative dynamics at 3PM order has been recently determined for the first time, via an amplitude calculation. Such PM results are most relevantly applicable to relativistic scattering (unbound orbits), while bound/inspiraling binary systems, the most frequent sources of gravitational waves for the LIGO and Virgo detectors, are most suitably modeled by the weak-field and slow-motion (post-Newtonian, PN) approximation. Nonetheless, it has been suggested that PM results can independently lead to improved modeling of bound binary dynamics, especially when taken as inputs for effective-one-body (EOB) models of inspiraling binaries. Here, we initiate a quantitative study of this possibility, by comparing PM, EOB and PN predictions for the binding energy of a two-body system on a quasi-circular inspiraling orbit against results of numerical relativity (NR) simulations. The binding energy is one of the two central ingredients (the other being the gravitational-wave energy flux) that enters the computation of gravitational waveforms employed by LIGO and Virgo detectors, and for (quasi-)circular orbits it provides an accurate diagnostic of the conservative sector of a model. We find that, whereas 3PM results do improve the agreement with NR with respect to 2PM (especially when used in the EOB framework), it is crucial to push PM calculations at higher orders if one wants to achieve better performances than current waveform models used for LIGO/Virgo data analysis.},

  abstract = {We introduce on-shell variables for Heavy Particle Effective Theories (HPETs) with the goal of extending Heavy Black Hole Effective Theory to higher spins and of facilitating its application to higher post-Minkowskian orders. These variables inherit the separation of spinless and spin-inclusive effects from the HPET fields, resulting in an explicit spin-multipole expansion of the three-point amplitude for any spin. By matching amplitudes expressed using the on-shell HPET variables to those derived from the one-particle effective action, we find that the spin-multipole expansion of a heavy spin-\$s\$ particle corresponds exactly to the multipole expansion (up to order \$2s\$) of a Kerr black hole, that is, without needing to take the infinite spin limit. Finally, we show that tree-level radiative processes with same-helicity bosons emitted from a heavy spin-\$s\$ particle exhibit a spin-multipole universality.},

The tidal deformability plays a prominent role in the former, while spectral properties of the gravitational-wave signal are important for the latter.

  abstract = {The grand challenges of contemporary fundamental physics---dark matter, dark energy, vacuum energy, inflation and early universe cosmology, singularities and the hierarchy problem---all involve gravity as a key component. And of all gravitational phenomena, black holes stand out in their elegant simplicity, while harbouring some of the most remarkable predictions of General Relativity: event horizons, singularities and ergoregions. The hitherto invisible landscape of the gravitational Universe is being unveiled before our eyes: the historical direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration marks the dawn of a new era of scientific exploration. Gravitational-wave astronomy will allow us to test models of black hole formation, growth and evolution, as well as models of gravitational-wave generation and propagation. It will provide evidence for event horizons and ergoregions, test the theory of General Relativity itself, and may reveal the existence of new fundamental fields. The synthesis of these results has the potential to radically reshape our understanding of the cosmos and of the laws of Nature. The purpose of this work is to present a concise, yet comprehensive overview of the state of the art in the relevant fields of research, summarize important open problems, and lay out a roadmap for future progress.},

We first lay the relevant formal foundation, describing the rigorous derivation of the equation of self-forced motion using matched asymptotic expansions and other ideas. We then review the progress that has been achieved in numerically calculating the self-force and its physical effects in the astrophysical scenario of a compact object inspiralling into a (rotating) massive black hole. We highlight the way in which, nowadays, self-force calculations make a fruitful contact with other approaches to the two-body problem and help inform an accurate universal model of binary black hole inspirals, valid across all mass ratios. We conclude with a summary of the state of the art, open problems and prospects. Our review is aimed at non-specialist readers and is for the most part self-contained and non-technical; only elementary-level acquaintance with General Relativity is assumed. Where useful, we draw on analogies with familiar concepts from Newtonian gravity or classical electrodynamics.},

  abstract = {At low redshift, massive black holes are found in the centers of almost all large elliptical galaxies, and also in many lower-mass systems. Their evolution is believed to be inextricably entangled with that of their host galaxies. On the one hand, the galactic environment provides gas for the black holes to grow via accretion and shine as active galactic nuclei. On the other hand, massive black holes are expected to backreact on the galactic dynamics, by injecting energy in their surroundings via jets or radiative feedback. Moreover, if galaxies and dark-matter halos form hierarchically, from small systems at high redshift coalescing into larger ones at more recent epochs, massive black holes may also merge, potentially generating gravitational-wave signals detectable by present and future experiments. In this Chapter, we discuss the predictions of current astrophysical models for the mergers of massive black holes in the mHz frequency band of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and in the nHz frequency band of pulsar-timing array experiments. We focus in particular on the astrophysical uncertainties affecting these predictions, including the poorly known dynamical evolution of massive black hole pairs at separations of hundreds of parsecs; the possible formation of 'stalled' binaries at parsec separations ('final-parsec problem'); and the effect of baryonic physics (e.g. SN feedback) on the growth of massive black holes. We show that nHz-band predictions are much more robust than in the mHz band, and comment on the implications of this fact for LISA and pulsar-timing arrays.},

Furthermore, the algebraic manipulations required in the back substitution are optimized. We describe in detail the implementation as well as the usage of the program.

As in the case of previously known prescriptions for various limits of momenta and masses, the terms of the threshold expansion are associated with subgraphs of a given graph and are explicitly written through Taylor expansions of the corresponding integrands in certain sets of parameters. They are manifestly homogeneous in the threshold expansion parameter, so that the calculation of the given Feynman integral near the threshold reduces to the calculation of integrals of a much simpler type. The general method is illustrated by two-loop two-point and three-point diagrams. We discuss the use of the threshold expansion for problems of physical interest, such as the next-to-next-to-leading order heavy quark production cross sections close to threshold and matching calculations and power counting in non-relativistic effective theories.},

As applications, we construct the one-loop amplitudes for n-gluon scattering in N = 1 supersymmetric theories with the helicity configuration of the Parke-Taylor tree amplitudes, and for six-gluon scattering in N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory for all helicity configurations.},

One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment, and 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design --- a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can have machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

Even though this problem has already been in place since the mid-twentieth century, we not only do not understand how to calculate all classes of these integrals beyond one loop, we do not even know in what class of functions the answer is expressed. To partially solve this problem, different variations of new functions called usually elliptic multiple polylogarithms have been introduced in the last decade. In this paper, we explore the possibilities and limitations of this class of functions. As a practical example, we chose the processes associated with the physics of heavy quarkonium at the two-loop level.},

It presents the theory of linearized perturbations about Minkowski spacetime of Einstein's equations, and shows how gauge transformations reduce the problem to the standard wave equation with two degrees of freedom, or polarizations, \$h\_+,h\_\textbackslash times\$. We derive the quadrupole formula, which relates the motion of matter in a source region to the far GW field. It is shown that GWs carry energy, as well as linear and angular momentum, away from a source. The GW field of an orbiting circular binary is found; and properties of the evolution of the binary including rate of inspiral and time to coalescence, are calculated. A brief review is given of existing and proposed GW detectors, and of how to estimate source parameters in LIGO or Virgo data of a GW event. The contributions that GW observations have already made to physics, astrophysics and cosmology are discussed.},

Since only long-distance interactions corresponding to non-analytic pieces need to be included, unitarity cuts provide substantial simplifications for both post-Newtonian and post-Minkowskian expansions. We illustrate this quantum field theoretic approach to classical general relativity by computing the interaction potentials to second order in the post-Newtonian expansion, as well as the scattering functions for two massive objects to second order in the post-Minkowskian expansion. We also derive an all-order exact result for gravitational light-by-light scattering.},

  abstract = {Gravitational waves generated by inspiralling compact binaries are investigated to the second--post-Newtonian (2PN) approximation of general relativity. Using a recently developed 2PN-accurate wave generation formalism, we compute the gravitational waveform and associated energy loss rate from a binary system of point-masses moving on a quasi-circular orbit. The crucial new input is our computation of the 2PN-accurate ``source'' quadrupole moment of the binary. Tails in both the waveform and energy loss rate at infinity are explicitly computed. Gravitational radiation reaction effects on the orbital frequency and phase of the binary are deduced from the energy loss. In the limiting case of a very small mass ratio between the two bodies we recover the results obtained by black hole perturbation methods. We find that finite mass ratio effects are very significant as they increase the 2PN contribution to the phase by up to 52\textbackslash\%. The results of this paper should be of use when deciphering the signals observed by the future LIGO/VIRGO network of gravitational-wave detectors.},

  abstract = {To be observed and analyzed by the network of gravitational wave detectors on ground (LIGO, VIRGO, etc.) and by the future detectors in space (LISA, etc.), inspiralling compact binaries --- binary star systems composed of neutron stars and/or black holes in their late stage of evolution --- require high-accuracy templates predicted by general relativity theory. The gravitational waves emitted by these very relativistic systems can be accurately modelled using a high-order post-Newtonian gravitational wave generation formalism. In this article, we present the current state of the art on post-Newtonian methods as applied to the dynamics and gravitational radiation of general matter sources (including the radiation reaction back onto the source) and inspiralling compact binaries. We describe the post-Newtonian equations of motion, in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, pay attention to the self-field regularizations at work, discuss several notions of innermost circular orbits and make comparisons with numerical gravitational self-force computations. The gravitational waveform and energy flux are obtained with high post-Newtonian precision. Some landmark results are discussed in the case of eccentric compact binaries moving on quasi-elliptical orbits, and on spin-orbit coupling effects in black hole binaries.},

Both methods use the rather special fact that the amplitude in this case is a family of periods associated to the universal family of elliptic curves over the modular curve X1(6). We show that the integral is given by an elliptic dilogarithm evaluated at a sixth root of unity modulo periods.

A method of approximation is used, and in the linear approximation retarded potentials corresponding to spherical gravitational waves are introduced. As is already known, the theory in this approximation predicts that energy is lost by the system. The field equations in the second, non-linear, approximation are then considered, and it is shown that the system loses an amount of gravitational mass precisely equal to the energy carried away by the spherical waves of the linear approximation. The result is established for a large class of particle motions, but it has not been possible to determine whether energy is lost in free gravitational motion under no external forces. The main conclusion of this work is that, contrary to opinions frequently expressed, gravitational radiation has a real physical existence, and in particular, carries energy away from the sources.},

  abstract = {We propose a method to compute the scattering angle for classical black hole scattering directly from two massive particle irreducible diagrams in a heavy-mass effective field theory approach to general relativity, without the need of subtracting iteration terms. The amplitudes in this effective theory are constructed using a recently proposed novel colour-kinematic/double copy for tree-level two-scalar, multi-graviton amplitudes, where the BCJ numerators are gauge invariant and local with respect to the massless gravitons. These tree amplitudes, together with graviton tree amplitudes, enter the construction of the required \$D\$-dimensional loop integrands and allow for a direct extraction of contributions relevant for classical physics. In particular the soft/heavy-mass expansions of full integrands is circumvented, and all iterating contributions can be dropped from the get go. We use this method to compute the scattering angle up to third post-Minkowskian order in four dimensions, including radiation reaction contributions, also providing the expression of the corresponding integrand in \$D\$ dimensions.},

This phenomenon is ubiquitous in many physical systems and also occurs for spinning black holes and stars, with far-reaching consequences for gravitational-wave astronomy and searches for new physics with astrophysical compact objects. In particular, ultralight bosonic fields (predicted in a variety of beyond-standard-model scenarios and compelling dark-matter candidates) can trigger superradiant instabilities in spinning black holes, forming macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensates around them. Striking features of this phenomenon include gaps in the spin-mass distribution of astrophysical black holes and a continuous gravitational-wave signal emitted by the condensate. We give a concise and coherent overview of the phenomenology of the superradiant instability, summarizing few decades of work in the area as well as recent developments.

These can be directly applied to the computation of four-mass scalar integral coefficients, and we explicitly present results in next-to-next-to-MHV amplitudes. For scalar box functions with at least one massless external leg we show that by doing the computation in signature (--++) the coefficients can also be obtained from quadruple cuts, which are not useful in Minkowski signature. As examples, we reproduce the coefficients of some one-, two-, and three-mass scalar box integrals of the seven-gluon next-to-MHV amplitude, and we compute several classes of three-mass and two-mass-hard coefficients of next-to-MHV amplitudes to all multiplicities.},

Our recursive framework is based on manipulating iterated integrals on Riemann surfaces with boundaries. A geometric parameter appears as variable of a differential equation of KZ or KZB type. The parameter interpolates between two associated regularized boundary values, which contain iterated integrals closely related to scattering amplitudes defined on two different geometries.},

We show that the subgroup under which the modular forms transform can naturally be identified with the monodromy group of a certain second-order differential operator. We provide an explicit decomposition of the spaces of modular forms into a direct sum of total derivatives and a basis of modular forms that cannot be written as derivatives of other functions, thereby generalising a result by one of the authors form the full modular group to arbitrary finite-index subgroups of genus zero. Finally, we apply our results to the two- and three-loop equal-mass banana integrals, and we obtain in particular for the first time complete analytic results for the higher orders in dimensional regularisation for the three-loop case, which involves iterated integrals of meromorphic modular forms.},

As the main example, we show how to obtain a compact formula for the fully relativistic classical one-loop contribution to the scattering of two particles with different masses. The non-relativistic limit of the leading singularity agrees with known results in the post-Newtonian expansion.

We study the monodromy of this connection and show that it gives rise to a relation between the KZ associator and a generating series for iterated integrals of Eisenstein forms. We show that the universal KZB connection is realized as the usual KZB connection for simple Lie algebras, and that in the \textbackslash (\textbackslash mathfrak \{sl\}\_n\textbackslash ) case this realization factors through the Cherednik algebras. This leads us to define a functor from the category of equivariant D-modules on \textbackslash (\textbackslash mathfrak \{sl\}\_n\textbackslash ) to that of modules over the Cherednik algebra, and to compute the character of irreducible equivariant D-modules over \textbackslash (\textbackslash mathfrak \{sl\}\_n\textbackslash ) that are supported on the nilpotent cone.},

We show how our system can practically solve some challenging problems: Can programmers implement their own high-level compiler optimizations for their domain-specific scientific programs, without the requirement of them being compiler experts at all? Can these optimizers be implemented by users in the same language and inside the same programs they want to optimize, solving the two-language problem? Can these compiler optimizers be written in a high-level fashion, as equations, without the need to worry about the rewriting ordering? Thus, can symbolic mathematics do high-level compiler optimizations or vice-versa?},

Given the significance of the astrophysical implications, it is important to first understand how their masses are measured from gravitational-wave signals. How accurate is the measurement? Are there elements missing in our current model which may result in a bias? This chapter is dedicated to these questions. In particular, we will highlight several astrophysical factors which are not included in the standard model of GW sources but could result in a significant bias in the estimation of the mass. These factors include strong gravitational lensing, the relative motion of the source, a nearby massive object, and a gaseous background.},

It is applicable for general spinning bodies with arbitrary spin multipole moments. The formula is linear in gravitational constant by definition, but exact to all orders in momentum and spin expansions. At each spin order, our formula implies that the spin-dependence and momentum dependence factorize almost completely. We expand our formula in momentum and compare the terms with 1PM parts of the post-Newtonian computations in the literature. Up to canonical transformations, our results agree perfectly with all previous ones. We also compare our formula for black hole to that derived from a spinning test-body near a Kerr black hole via the effective one-body mapping, and find perfect agreement.},

We also provide a detailed discussion of the category which has sets as objects, relations as morphisms, and the cartesian product as its monoidal structure (Rel), and thirdly, categories with manifolds as objects and cobordisms between these as morphisms (2Cob). While sets, Hilbert spaces and manifolds do not share any non-trivial common structure, these three categories are in fact structurally very similar. Shared features are diagrammatic calculus, compact closed structure and particular kinds of internal comonoids which play an important role in each of them. The categories FdHilb and Rel moreover admit a categorical matrix calculus. Together these features guide us towards topological quantum field theories. We also discuss posetal categories, how group representations are in fact categorical constructs, and what strictification and coherence of monoidal categories is all about. In our attempt to complement the existing literature we omitted some very basic topics. For these we refer the reader to other available sources.},

A known problem is that the operators that they use to create asymptotic states create much else besides the intended particles for a scattering process. In the infinite-time limits appropriate to scattering, the extra contributions only disappear in matrix elements with normalizable states, rather than in the created states themselves, i.e., the infinite-time limits of the LSZ creation operators are weak limits. The extra particles that are created are in a different region of space-time than the intended scattering process. To be able to work with particle creation at non-asymptotic times, e.g., to give a transparent and fully deductive treatment for scattering with long-lived unstable particles, it is necessary to have operators for which the infinite-time limits are strong limits. In this paper, I give an improved method of constructing such operators. I use them to give an improved systematic account of scattering theory in relativistic quantum field theories, including a new proof of the reduction formula. I make explicit calculations to illustrate the problems with the LSZ operators and their solution with the new operators. Not only do these verify the existence of the extra particles created by the LSZ operators and indicate a physical interpretation, but they also show that the extra components are so large that their contribution to the norm of the state is ultra-violet divergent in renormalizable theories. Finally, I discuss the relation of this work to the work of Haag and Ruelle on scattering theory.},

  abstract = {The current cosmological model hypothesizes a period of exponential spatial expansion in the earliest moments of the universe to explain several inconsistencies in observations of the universe, including the thermal equilibrium of the CMB at otherwise super-horizon scales, and the observed spatial flatness of the universe. Inflation would expand space by at least 60 e-folds in 10-32 s in order to explain the observed flatness and homogeneity of the universe. Inflationary field theories generically predict inhomogeneities in the inflaton field, which will result in metric perturbations (gravitational waves, GWs) during and after the inflationary epoch. These primordial GWs affect the density of the primordial plasma, leaving an imprint that can be detected as curl-modes (referred to as ``B-modes'' in analogy with the electromagnetic field equations) in the polarization vector field of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Many CMB telescopes are currently seeking to detect this B-mode signature of cosmic inflation. This chapter contains a review of the basic physics of the CMB and the spectrum of primordial GWs, with discussions of weak lensing, reionization, and foregrounds, as well as an overview of relevant CMB experiments and instrumentation, and current and expected constraints on GWs.},

In contrast to the four-dimensional case, in higher dimensions the classical potential receives contributions from box topologies. Moreover, the kinematical relation between momentum and position on the classical trajectory contains a new term which is quadratic in the tree-level amplitude. A precise interplay between this new relation and the formula for the scattering angle ensures that the latter is still linear in the classical part of the scattering amplitude, to this order, matching an earlier calculation in the eikonal approach. We point out that both the eikonal exponentiation and the reality of the potential to 2nd post-Minkowskian order can be seen as a consequence of unitarity. We finally present closed-form expressions for the scattering angle given by leading-order gravitational potentials for dimensions ranging from four to ten.},

The quantum degeneracies of single-centered black holes are Fourier coefficients of this mock Jacobi form, while the Appell-Lerch sum captures the degeneracies of multi-centered black holes which decay upon wall-crossing. The completion of the mock Jacobi form restores the modular symmetries expected from AdS3/CF T2 holography but has a holomorphic anomaly reflecting the non-compactness of the microscopic CFT. For every positive integral value m of the magnetic charge invariant of the black hole, our analysis leads to a special mock Jacobi form of weight two and index m, which we characterize uniquely up to a Jacobi cusp form. This family of special forms and another closely related family of weight-one forms contain almost all the known mock modular forms including the mock theta functions of Ramanujan, the generating function of Hurwitz-Kronecker class numbers, the mock modular forms appearing in the Mathieu and Umbral moonshine, as well as an infinite number of new examples.},

The resulting (second post-Minkowskian) Hamiltonian is found to have a tame high-energy structure which we relate both to gravitational self-force studies of large mass-ratio binary systems, and to the ultra high-energy quantum scattering results of Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano. We derive several consequences of our second post-Minkowskian Hamiltonian: (i) the need to use special phase-space gauges to get a tame high-energy limit; and (ii) predictions about a (rest-mass independent) linear Regge trajectory behavior of high-angular-momenta, high-energy circular orbits. Ways of testing these predictions by dedicated numerical simulations are indicated. We finally indicate a way to connect our classical results to the quantum gravitational scattering amplitude of two particles, and we urge amplitude experts to use their novel techniques to compute the 2-loop scattering amplitude of scalar masses, from which one could deduce the third post-Minkowskian effective one-body Hamiltonian.},

The described methods for 3-point and 4-point integrals are, in particular, applicable in the case where the conventional Passarino-Veltman reduction breaks down owing to the appearance of Gram determinants in the denominator. One method consists of different variants for expanding tensor coefficients about limits of vanishing Gram determinants or other kinematical determinants, thereby reducing all tensor coefficients to the usual scalar integrals. In a second method a specific tensor coefficient with a logarithmic integrand is evaluated numerically, and the remaining coefficients as well as the standard scalar integral are algebraically derived from this coefficient. For 5-point tensor integrals, we give explicit formulas that reduce the corresponding tensor coefficients to coefficients of 4-point integrals with tensor rank reduced by one. Similar formulas are provided for 6-point functions, and the generalization to functions with more internal propagators is straightforward. All the presented methods are also applicable if infrared (soft or collinear) divergences are treated in dimensional regularization or if mass parameters (for unstable particles) become complex.},

The simplest examples of eMGFs are given by the Green function for a massless scalar field on the torus and the Zagier single-valued elliptic polylogarithms. More complicated eMGFs are produced by the non-separating degeneration of a higher genus surface to a genus one surface with punctures. eMGFs may equivalently be represented by multiple integrals over the torus of combinations of coefficients of the Kronecker-Eisenstein series, and may be assembled into generating series. These relations are exploited to derive holomorphic subgraph reduction formulas, as well as algebraic and differential identities between eMGFs and their generating series. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s).},

In Sect. 14.1.1, after having introduced the affine Lie algebras per se, we show how the fundamental concepts of roots, weights, Cartan matrices, and Weyl groups are extended to the affine case. Section 14.2 introduces the outer automorphism group of affine Lie algebras, which is generated by the new symmetry transformations of the extended Dynkin diagram. The following section describes highest-weight representations, focusing on those whose highest weight is dominant. Characters for these representations are introduced in Sect. 14.4. Their modular properties are presented in the following sections, where various properties of their modular S matrices are also reported. The affine extension of finite Lie algebra embeddings is presented in Sect. 14.7. Four appendices complete the chapter. The first one contains the proof of a technical identity related to outer automorphism groups. The second appendix displays an explicit basis (in terms of semi-infinite paths) for the states in integrable representations of affine su(N). In the third one, the modular transformation properties of the affine characters are derived. The final appendix lists all the symbols pertaining to affine Lie algebras.},

Such models are somewhat peculiar among conformal field theories in that they can be formulated directly in terms of an action. We will thus introduce them by means of this action and show how to extract from it their algebraic structure, which provides them with an alternative algebraic definition. Special emphasis is placed on the formulation of the concept of primary field, and its relation with the integrable representations of the affine algebra \^g. A key construction along this program is that of the Sugawara energy-momentum tensor, which is presented in great detail. It leads directly to a differential equation for the correlation functions, the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation, of which simple solutions are presented. In the second part of the chapter, we present various free-field representations. In addition to being extremely useful computational tools, they provide an illustration of the different concepts introduced in the first part.},

Our aim in this chapter is to present a detailed study of its continuum limit, in the framework of conformally invariant (free fermionic or bosonic) field theories. After reviewing basic facts on the statistical-mechanical model, we concentrate on its continuum fermionic representation. This framework is particularly suitable for the computation of correlation functions of the energy operator on the plane. For correlations involving the spin operator, it is more convenient to consider a bosonic field theory, made of two independent Ising models. In this bosonic formulation, the spin operator has a simple realization in terms of the free field. To complete the study of correlators, we also present the solution of the continuum Ising model on the torus, and use it as an illustrative example of the general theory of conformal blocks covered in Chaps. 9 and 10.},

  abstract = {This chapter describes a representation of the conformal fields of minimal models in terms of vertex operators built from a free boson with special boundary conditions. This representation bears the name of Coulomb gas or modified Coulomb gas. This terminology comes from the resemblance of the free boson correla \textbackslash (\textbackslash left\textbackslash langle \{\textbackslash varphi (z,\textbackslash bar z)\} \textbackslash right.\textbackslash left. \{\textbackslash varphi (w,\textbackslash bar w)\} \textbackslash right\textbackslash rangle = - \textbackslash ln \{\textbackslash left| \{z - w\} \textbackslash right|\^2\}\textbackslash ) with the electric potential energy between two unit charges in two dimensions. In Sect. 9.1, we calculate the correlation function of vertex operators and indicate how the symmetry {$\varphi$} \textrightarrow{} {$\varphi$} + a of the boson theory imposes a constraint (the neutrality condition) on this correlation function. We then modify the free-boson action\textemdash or, equivalently, the energy-momentum tensor\textemdash and this modifies the central charge and the neutrality condition. This section is supplemented by App. 9.A, where the calculation of the modified energy-momentum tensor is detailed. In Sect. 9.2, we introduce the notion of screening operators and describe how the insertion of such operators in bosonic correlation functions allows for a sort of projection onto minimal-model correlation functions. Examples of correlation functions are calculated. Finally, in Sect. 9.3, we explain the general structure of the minimal-model correlation functions in this formalism. Special attention is devoted to the properties of conformal blocks, and the idea of a conformal field theory defined on a surface of arbitrary genus is introduced. The mathematical setting of the Coulomb-gas representation of minimal models (i.e., BRST cohomology of the bosonic Fock spaces) is described in App. 9.B.},

Section 3.1 reviews the notion of statistical ensemble of states and describes some basic models defined on the lattice or in the continuum. Section 3.2 explains the basic features of critical phenomena and how the scaling hypothesis provides a unified understanding of phenomena at or near the critical point. Section 3.3 justifies the scaling hypothesis with the idea of real-space renormalization. Section 3.4 applies the concepts of the renormalization group to continuum models and gives deeper meaning to the notion of scale invariance for Euclidian field theories. Finally, Sect. 3.5 briefly explains the transfer matrix method, a discrete analogue in statistical mechanics of the operator formalism of quantum theory.},

This is an immediate motivation for devoting a complete chapter to Lie algebras. But as subsequent developments will show, conformal field theories with nonaffine additional symmetries, such as W algebras, parafermions, and son on, as well as related exactly solvable statistical models, also have a deep Lie-algebraic underlying structure, which can only be appreciated with a minimal background on simple Lie algebras.},

In fact, the two sectors may constitute distinct theories on their own since they do not interfere: Correlation functions factorize into holomorphic and antiholomorphic factors with a priori different properties. However, this situation is very unphysical. The decoupling exists only at the fixed point in parameter space (the conformally invariant point) and in the infinite-plane geometry. The physical spectrum of the theory should be continuously deformed as we leave the critical point, and the coupling between right and left sectors away from this point should lead to some constraints on the left and right content of the theory at the fixed point. In operator language, this implies that not every left-right combination of Verma modules is physically sound.},

  abstract = {Chapters 5 and 6 dealt with general properties of two-dimensional conformal field theories. The present chapter is devoted to particularly simple conformal theories called minimal models. These theories are characterized by a Hilbert space made of a finite number of representations of the Virasoro algebra (Verma modules); in other words, the number of conformal families is finite. Such theories describe discrete statistical models (e.g., Ising, Potts, and so on) at their critical points. Their simplicity in principle allows for a complete solution (i.e., an explicit calculation of all the correlation functions). The discovery of minimal models and their identification with known statistical models at criticality constitutes the greatest application of conformal invariance so far. Since a detailed study of minimal models may rapidly become highly technical, we have split the discussion among two chapters (this one and the next). The present chapter first explains some general features of Verma modules (Sect. 7.1), and in particular the occurrence of states of zero norm, which must be quotiented out. In Sect. 7.2 the question of unitarity is discussed and the Kac determinant is introduced. In Sect. 7.3 a survey of the theory of minimal models is presented. In Sect. 7.4 various examples of the correspondence between minimal theories and statistical systems are described. The next chapter will be devoted to more technical issues and will provide proofs for some assertions of the present chapter.},

In elaborating more complex systems involving scores of epicycles and eccentrics, they gave up the idea that celestial orbits should be explicitly symmetric, but invented unknowingly the concept of ``hidden symmetry'', for the circle remained the building block of their cosmology. Modern science, with Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, gave symmetry a deeper realm: that of the physical ``laws.'' Circles gave way to ellipses and more complicated trajectories; the richness and variety of Nature became, in the Heavens like on Earth, compatible with symmetric laws, even without the exterior appearance of symmetry.},

In Sect. 4.2 we study the action of a conformal transformation on fields, at the classical level. The notion of a quasi-primary field is defined. We relate scale invariance, conformal invariance, and the tracelessness of the energy momentum tensor. In Sect. 4.3 we look at the consequences of conformal invariance at the quantum level on the structure of correlation functions. The form of the two- and three-point functions is given, and the Ward identities implied by conformal invariance are derived.

  abstract = {This chapter is mainly concerned with the calculation of fusion rules in WZW models. As in any rational conformal field theory, fusion rules can be calculated from the Verlinde formula, in terms of the modular transformation matrices S. For WZW models, all these matrices are known explicitly. However, working out a few examples is convincing enough that the Verlinde formula is not very convenient for explicit calculations. Indeed, the dimension of the matrix S grows very quickly with the level and the rank of the algebra. Nevertheless, the formula itself allows us to derive useful identities (which is done in Sect. 16.1), in addition to being the starting point for a more efficient approach: the affine extension of the character method used for the calculation of tensor products in finite Lie algebra. This method is described in Sect. 16.2. It leads to a very nice relation between tensor-product coefficients and fusion coefficients. The concept of quantum dimension, naturally related to the character method, is introduced in Sect. 16.3.},

  abstract = {Conformal invariance takes a new meaning in two dimensions. As already apparent in Section 4.1, the case d = 2 requires special attention. Indeed, there exists in two dimensions an infinite variety of coordinate transformations that, although not everywhere well-defined, are locally conformal: they are holomorphic mappings from the complex plane (or part of it) onto itself. Among this infinite set of mappings one must distinguish the 6-parameter global conformal group, made of one-to-one mappings of the complex plane into itself. The analysis of the previous chapter still holds when considering these transformations only. However, a local field theory should be sensitive to local symmetries, even if the related transformations are not globally defined. It is local conformal invariance that enables exact solutions of two-dimensional conformal field theories.},

We find that in this limit the real part of the eikonal, determining the deflection angle, is universal for gravitational theories in the two derivative approximation. This means that, regardless of the number of supersymmetries or the nature of the probes, the result connects smoothly with the massless case discussed since the late eighties by Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano. We analyse the problem both by using the analyticity and crossing properties of the scattering amplitudes and, in the case of the maximally supersymmetric theory, by explicit evaluation of the 4-point 2-loop amplitude using the results for the integrals in the full soft region. The first approach shows that the observable we are interested in is determined by the inelastic tree-level amplitude describing the emission of a graviton in the high-energy double-Regge limit, which is the origin of the universality property mentioned above. The second approach strongly suggests that the inclusion of the whole soft region is a necessary (and possibly sufficient) ingredient for recovering ultra relativistic finiteness and universality at the 3PM level. We conjecture that this universality persists at all orders in the PM expansion.},

We employ the eikonal phase to obtain the physical deflection angle and to show how its non-relativistic (NR) and ultra-relativistic (UR) regimes are smoothly connected. Such a smooth interpolation rests on keeping contributions to the loop integrals originating from the full soft region, rather than restricting it to its potential sub-region. This task is efficiently carried out by using the method of differential equations with complete near-static boundary conditions. In contrast to the potential-region result, the physical deflection angle includes radiation-reaction contributions that are essential for recovering the finite and universal UR limit implied by general analyticity and crossing arguments. We finally discuss the real emission of massless states, which accounts for the imaginary part of the 3PM eikonal and for the dissipation of energy-momentum. Adopting a direct approach based on unitarity and on the classical limit of the inelastic tree-level amplitude, we are able to treat \$\textbackslash mathcal N=8\$ and General Relativity on the same footing, and to complete the conservative 3PM eikonal in Einstein's gravity by the addition of the radiation-reaction contribution. We also show how this approach can be used to compute waveforms, as well as the differential and integrated spectra, for the different radiated massless fields.},

Multiple binary black hole and binary neutron star systems have been detected, and while we are still waiting for the first confirmed observation of a mixed black hole-neutron star (BHNS) merger, a number of candidate events have been announced over the last observing run of the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration. BHNS mergers have many of the same advantages as neutron star mergers, including their potential to help us constrain the properties of dense nuclear matter and their ability to power bright electromagnetic counterparts and produce heavy r-process elements. There are however important differences between BHNS and binary neutron star mergers that significantly impact what we can hope to accomplish from their observation. In this chapter, we will review the basic physics of BHNS mergers and the properties of the observable gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals that they power. We will also discuss the current status of theoretical and numerical models of these signals, their successes, limitations, and likely future areas of improvements. Finally, we will consider the role that these models play in the robust interpretation of BHNS observations and how current model limitations impact what we can learn from multi-messenger observations of BHNS binaries.},

Despite its utility, Hamilton's principle has a subtle pitfall that often goes unnoticed in physics: it is formulated as a boundary value problem in time but is used to derive equations of motion that are solved with initial data. This subtlety can have undesirable effects. I present a formulation of Hamilton's principle that is compatible with initial value problems. Remarkably, this leads to a natural formulation for the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics of generic non-conservative systems, thereby filling a long-standing gap in classical mechanics. Thus dissipative effects, for example, can be studied with new tools that may have application in a variety of disciplines. The new formalism is demonstrated by two examples of non-conservative systems: an object moving in a fluid with viscous drag forces and a harmonic oscillator coupled to a dissipative environment.},

  abstract = {We present an Effective Field Theory (EFT) formalism which describes the dynamics of non-relativistic extended objects coupled to gravity. The formalism is relevant to understanding the gravitational radiation power spectra emitted by binary star systems, an important class of candidate signals for gravitational wave observatories such as LIGO or VIRGO. The EFT allows for a clean separation of the three relevant scales: r\_s, the size of the compact objects, r the orbital radius and r/v, the wavelength of the physical radiation (where the velocity v is the expansion parameter). In the EFT radiation is systematically included in the v expansion without need to separate integrals into near zones and radiation zones. We show that the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences which arise at v\^6 in post-Newtonian (PN) calculations requires the presence of two non-minimal worldline gravitational couplings linear in the Ricci curvature. However, these operators can be removed by a redefinition of the metric tensor, so that the divergences at arising at v\^6 have no physically observable effect. Because in the EFT finite size features are encoded in the coefficients of non-minimal couplings, this implies a simple proof of the decoupling of internal structure for spinless objects to at least order v\^6. Neglecting absorptive effects, we find that the power counting rules of the EFT indicate that the next set of short distance operators, which are quadratic in the curvature and are associated with tidal deformations, do not play a role until order v\^10. These operators, which encapsulate finite size properties of the sources, have coefficients that can be fixed by a matching calculation. By including the most general set of such operators, the EFT allows one to work within a point particle theory to arbitrary orders in v.},

The present article is an extract of a report on a feasibility study of gravitational wave detection in space, commissioned by the National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences almost a decade ago. The objective of the study was to explore various possible mission options to detect gravitational waves in space alternative to that of the (e)LISA mission concept and look into the requirements on the technological fronts. On the basis of relative merits and balance between science and technological feasibility, a set of representative mission options were studied and in the end a mission design was recommended as the starting point for research and development in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The mission design was eventually adopted by the current TAIJI mission as the baseline parameters for the project. Subject to technological constraints, the baseline parameters of the TAIJI mission were designed in such a way to optimise the capability of a spaceborne gravitational wave detector to probe high redshift light seed, intermediate mass black holes and thereby shed important light on the structure formation in early Universe.},

In the gravitational case this leads to higher order terms in the post-Newtonian expansion, which have been previously used in the binary inspiral problem. The expressions are obtained in terms of a contour integral that computes the Leading Singularity, which was recently shown to encode the relevant information up to one loop. The classical limit is performed along a holomorphic trajectory in the space of kinematics, such that the leading order is enough to extract arbitrarily high multipole corrections. These multipole interactions are given in terms of a recently proposed representation for massive particles of any spin by Arkani-Hamed et al. This explicitly shows universality of the multipole interactions in the effective potential with respect to the spin of the scattered particles. We perform the explicit match to standard EFT operators for \$S=\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}\$ and \$S=1\$. As a natural byproduct we obtain the classical pieces up to one loop for the bending of light.},

  abstract = {The problem of two interacting masses is investigated within the framework of geometrodynamics. It is assumed that the space-time continuum is free of all real sources of mass or charge; particles are identified with multiply connected regions of empty space. Particular attention is focused on an asymptotically flat space containing a "handle" or "wormhole." When the two "mouths" of the wormhole are well separated, they seem to appear as two centers of gravitational attraction of equal mass. To simplify the problem, it is assumed that the metric is invariant under rotations about the axis of symmetry, and symmetric with respect to the time t = 0 of maximum separation of the two mouths. Analytic initial value data for this case have been obtained by Misner; these contain two arbitrary parameters, which are uniquely determined when the mass of the two mouths and their initial separation have been specified. We treat a particular case in which the ratio of mass to initial separation is approximately one-half. To determine a unique solution of the remaining (dynamic) field equations, the coordinate conditions g0 {$\alpha$} = - {$\delta$}0 {$\alpha$} are imposed; then the set of second order equations is transformed into a quasilinear first order system and the difference scheme of Friedrichs used to obtain a numerical solution. Its behavior agrees qualitatively with that of the one-body problem, and can be interpreted as a mutual attraction and pinching-off of the two mouths of the wormhole.},

  abstract = {Can the S-matrix be complexified in a way consistent with causality? Since the 1960's, the affirmative answer to this question has been well-understood for 2 \textrightarrow{} 2 scattering of the lightest particle in theories with a mass gap at low momentum transfer, where the S-matrix is analytic everywhere except at normal-threshold branch cuts. We ask whether an analogous picture extends to realistic theories, such as the Standard Model, that include massless fields, UV/IR divergences, and unstable particles. Especially in the presence of light states running in the loops, the traditional i{$\epsilon$} prescription for approaching physical regions might break down, because causality requirements for the individual Feynman diagrams can be mutually incompatible. We demonstrate that such analyticity problems are not in contradiction with unitarity. Instead, they should be thought of as finite-width effects that disappear in the idealized 2 \textrightarrow{} 2 scattering amplitudes with no unstable particles, but might persist at higher multiplicity. To fix these issues, we propose an i{$\epsilon$}-like prescription for deforming branch cuts in the space of Mandelstam invariants without modifying the analytic properties. This procedure results in a complex strip around the real part of the kinematic space, where the S-matrix remains causal. In addition to giving a pedagogical introduction to the analytic properties of the perturbative S-matrix from a modern point of view, we illustrate all the points on explicit examples, both symbolically and numerically. To help with the investigation of related questions, we introduce a number of tools, including holomorphic cutting rules, new approaches to dispersion relations, as well as formulae for local behavior of Feynman integrals near branch points.},

  abstract = {Neutron star interiors are a fantastic laboratory for high density physics in extreme environments. Probing this system with standard electromagnetic observations is, however, a challenging endeavour, as the radiation tends to be scattered by the outer layers and the interstellar medium. Gravitational waves, on the other hand, while challenging to detect, interact weakly with matter and are likely to carry a clean imprint of the high density interior of the star. In particular long lived, i.e. `continuous' signals from isolated neutron stars can carry a signature of deformations, possibly in crystalline exotic layers of the core, or allow to study modes of oscillation, thus performing gravitational wave asteroseismology of neutron star interiors. In this article we will review current theoretical models for continuous gravitational wave emission, and observational constraints, both electromagnetic and gravitational. Finally we will discuss future observational possibilities.},

We argue that a good choice of basis for (multi)loop integrals can lead to significant simplifications of the differential equations, and propose criteria for finding an optimal basis. This builds on experience obtained in supersymmetric field theories that can be applied successfully to generic quantum field theory integrals. It involves studying leading singularities and explicit integral representations. When the differential equations are cast into canonical form, their solution becomes elementary. The class of functions involved is easily identified, and the solution can be written down to any desired order in {$\epsilon$} within dimensional regularization. Results obtained in this way are particularly simple and compact. In this Letter, we outline the general ideas of the method and apply them to a two-loop example.},

We focus on the gravitational impulse with radiation reaction and the radiated momentum in black hole scattering at \$\textbackslash mathcal O(G\^3)\$ to all orders in the velocity. These classical observables require the construction and evaluation of certain loop-level quantities which are greatly simplified by harnessing recent advances from scattering amplitudes and collider physics. In particular, we make use of generalized unitarity to construct the relevant loop integrands, employ reverse unitarity, the method of regions, integration-by-parts (IBP), and (canonical) differential equations to simplify and evaluate all loop and phase-space integrals to obtain the classical gravitational observables of interest to two-loop order. The KMOC formalism naturally incorporates radiation effects which enables us to explore these classical quantities beyond the conservative two-body dynamics. From the impulse and the radiated momentum, we extract the scattering angle and the radiated energy. Finally, we discuss universality of the impulse in the high-energy limit and the relation to the eikonal phase.},

The solution is obtained by direct integration of the Feynman parametric representation. When the IPP depends on one elliptic curve (and no other algebraic functions), this class of Feynman integrals can be algorithmically solved in terms of elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) by using integration by parts identities. We then elaborate on the differential equations method. Specifically, we show that the IPP can be mapped to a generalized integral topology satisfying a set of differential equations in {$\epsilon$}-form. In the examples we consider the canonical differential equations can be directly solved in terms of eMPLs up to arbitrary order of the dimensional regulator. The remaining 1-dimensional integral may be performed to express such integrals completely in terms of eMPLs. We apply these methods to solve two- and three-points integrals in terms of eMPLs. We analytically continue these integrals to the physical region by using their 1-dimensional integral representation.},

The propagator depends on twelve arbitrary functions of k\^2, k being the space part of the momentum of the graviton. The arbitrariness of the gauge functions can be used to remove the ambiguity of one-graviton exchange potential up to the order of (G/r)(v/c)\^4, G being the gravitational constant. The potential thus obtained depends only one gauge parameter, say x. The perihelion motion of two-body system is gauge independent, although the potentials in the order of (G/r)(v/c)\^2 and G\^2/r\^2 depend on the gauge parameter x. The potentials are derived from those in a fixed gauge parameter x by a coordinate transformation.},

Gravitational waves, electromagnetic waves, neutrinos and cosmic rays cover a wide range of wavelengths and time scales. Combining and processing these datasets that vary in volume, speed and dimensionality requires new modes of instrument coordination, funding and international collaboration with a specialized human and technological infrastructure. In tandem with the advent of large-scale scientific facilities, the last decade has experienced an unprecedented transformation in computing and signal processing algorithms. The combination of graphics processing units, deep learning, and the availability of open source, high-quality datasets, have powered the rise of artificial intelligence. This digital revolution now powers a multi-billion dollar industry, with far-reaching implications in technology and society. In this chapter we describe pioneering efforts to adapt artificial intelligence algorithms to address computational grand challenges in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics. We review the rapid evolution of these disruptive algorithms, from the first class of algorithms introduced in early 2017, to the sophisticated algorithms that now incorporate domain expertise in their architectural design and optimization schemes. We discuss the importance of scientific visualization and extreme-scale computing in reducing time-to-insight and obtaining new knowledge from the interplay between models and data.},

We first provide the essential elements of gravitational radiation physics within a simple Newtonian orbital dynamics and the linearized gravity theory, describing the adiabatic approximation applied to binary systems: the key element to construct the theoretical gravitational waveforms in practice. We next lay out the gravitational waveforms in the post-Newtonian approximation to General Relativity, and highlight the basic input for the inspiral waveform of the slowly evolving, spinning, nonprecessing, quasicircular binary black holes, namely, post-Newtonian energy, fluxes and the (absorption-corrected) balance equation. The post-Newtonian inspiral templates are then presented both in the time and frequency domain. Finally, including the merger and subsequent ringdown phase, we briefly survey the two families of the full waveform models of compact binary mergers currently implemented in LSC Algorithm Library Simulation: the effective-one-body approach and the phenomenological frequency domain model.},

The metric is related to the three-point vertex function of a massive scalar interacting with a graviton to all orders in \$G\_N\$, and the one-loop contribution to this amplitude is computed from which the \$G\_N\^2\$ contribution to the metric is derived. To understand the gauge-dependence of the metric, covariant gauge is used which introduces the parameter, \$\textbackslash xi\$, and the gauge-fixing function \$G\_\textbackslash sigma\$. In the classical limit, the gauge-fixing function turns out to be the coordinate condition, \$G\_\textbackslash sigma=0\$. As gauge-fixing function a novel family of gauges, which depends on an arbitrary parameter \$\textbackslash alpha\$ and includes both harmonic and de Donder gauge, is used. Feynman rules for the graviton field are derived and important results are the graviton propagator in covariant gauge and a general formula for the n-graviton vertex in terms of the Einstein tensor. The Feynman rules are used both in deriving the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric from amplitudes and in the computation of the one-loop correction to the metric. The one-loop correction to the metric is independent of the covariant gauge parameter, \$\textbackslash xi\$, and satisfies the gauge condition \$G\_\textbackslash sigma=0\$ where \$G\_\textbackslash sigma\$ is the family of gauges depending on \$\textbackslash alpha\$. In space-time \$D=5\$ a logarithm appears in position space and this phenomena is analyzed in terms of redundant gauge freedom.},

  abstract = {We recently introduced in [1910.03008] a "boundary-to-bound" dictionary between gravitational scattering data and observables for bound states of non-spinning bodies. In this paper, we elaborate further on this (holographic) map. We start by deriving the following -- remarkably simple -- formula relating the periastron advance to the scattering angle: \$\textbackslash Delta \textbackslash Phi(J,\{\textbackslash cal E\}) =\textbackslash chi(J,\{\textbackslash cal E\}) + \textbackslash chi (-J,\{\textbackslash cal E\})\$, via analytic continuation in angular momentum and binding energy. Using explicit expressions from [1910.03008], we confirm its validity to all orders in the Post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion. Furthermore, we reconstruct the radial action for the bound state directly from the knowledge of the scattering angle. The radial action enables us to write compact expressions for dynamical invariants in terms of the deflection angle to all PM orders, which can also be written as a function of the PM-expanded amplitude. As an example, we reproduce our result in [1910.03008] for the periastron advance, and compute the radial and azimuthal frequencies and redshift variable to two-loops. Agreement is found in the overlap between PM and Post-Newtonian (PN) schemes. Last but not least, we initiate the study of our dictionary including spin. We demonstrate that the same relation between deflection angle and periastron advance applies for aligned-spin contributions, with \$J\$ the (canonical) total angular momentum. Explicit checks are performed to display perfect agreement using state-of-the-art PN results in the literature. Using the map between test- and two-body dynamics, we also compute the periastron advance up to quadratic order in the spin, to one-loop and to all orders in velocity. We conclude with a discussion on the generalized "impetus formula" for spinning bodies and black holes as "elementary particles".},

  abstract = {We introduce a -- somewhat holographic -- dictionary between gravitational observables for scattering processes (measured at "the boundary") and adiabatic invariants for bound orbits (in "the bulk"), to all orders in the Post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion. Our map relies on remarkable connections between the relative momentum of the two-body problem, the classical limit of the scattering amplitude and the deflection angle in hyperbolic motion. These relationships allow us to compute observables for generic closed orbits, such as the periastron advance \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash Phi\$, from the unbound case through analytic continuation. A simplified (more geometrical) map can be obtained for circular orbits, enabling us to extract the orbital frequency as a function of the (conserved) binding energy, \$\textbackslash Omega(E)\$, from scattering data. As an example, using the results in Bern et al. [1901.04424, 1908.01493], we readily derive \$\textbackslash Omega(E)\$ and \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash Phi(J,E)\$ to two-loop orders. We also provide a closed-form expression for the orbital frequency and periastron advance at tree-level and one-loop order, respectively, which capture a series of exact terms in the Post-Newtonian expansion. We then perform a partial PM resummation, using a "no-recoil" approximation for the amplitude. This limit is behind the map between the scattering angle for a test-particle and the two-body dynamics to 2PM. We show that it also captures a subset of higher order terms beyond the test-particle limit. While a (rather lengthy) Hamiltonian may be derived as an intermediate step, our map applies directly between gauge invariant quantities. Our findings provide a starting point for an alternative approach to the binary problem. We conclude with future directions and some speculations on the classical double copy.},

  abstract = {We develop an Effective Field Theory (EFT) formalism to solve for the conservative dynamics of binary systems in gravity via Post-Minkowskian (PM) scattering data. Our framework combines a systematic EFT approach to compute the deflection angle in the PM expansion, together with the 'Boundary-to-Bound' (B2B) dictionary introduced in [1910.03008, 1911.09130]. Due to the nature of scattering processes, a remarkable reduction of complexity occurs both in the number of Feynman diagrams and type of integrals, compared to a direct EFT computation of the potential in a PM scheme. We provide two illustrative examples. Firstly, we compute all the conservative gravitational observables for bound orbits to 2PM, which follow from only one topology beyond leading order. The results agree with those in [1910.03008, 1911.09130], obtained through the 'impetus formula' applied to the classical limit of the one loop amplitude in Cheung et al. [1808.02489]. For the sake of comparison we reconstruct the conservative Hamiltonian to 2PM order, which is equivalent to the one derived in [1808.02489] from a matching calculation. Secondly, we compute the scattering angle due to tidal effects from the electric- and magnetic-type Love numbers at leading PM order. Using the B2B dictionary we then obtain the tidal contribution to the periastron advance. We also construct a Hamiltonian including tidal effects at leading PM order. Although relying on (relativistic) Feynman diagrams, the EFT formalism developed here does not involve taking the classical limit of a quantum amplitude, neither integrals with internal massive fields, nor additional matching calculations, nor spurious ('super-classical') infrared singularities. By construction, the EFT approach can be automatized to all PM orders.},

How do black holes find each other in vast space, form binaries, and get so close to one another that gravitational wave emission can successfully merge them within the present age of the universe? In this chapter we review the dynamical formation channel, where the binary separation is reduced by dynamical processes. These processes are important for mergers in dense stellar clusters, galactic nuclei, mergers in supermassive black hole accretion disks, and mergers in stellar triple and quadruple systems and possibly in the dark matter halo. We introduce a unified framework to interpret the theoretical expectations on the characteristics of these merging binaries such as their gravitational wave frequency, eccentricity, mass, and spins to identify these gravitational wave source populations in merger catalogs. For dynamical merger pathways, we show that GW source catalogs carry information on the escape velocity of the host environment.},

  abstract = {We review the observed demographics and inferred evolution of supermassive black holes (BHs) found by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass and the velocity dispersion of the host-galaxy bulge. It and other correlations led to the belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. BHs are found in pure-disk galaxies, so classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary to grow BHs. But BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. And any correlations with disk-grown pseudobulges or halo dark matter are so weak as to imply no close coevolution. We suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. 1- Local, stochastic feeding of small BHs in mainly bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. 2- Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers grows giant BHs in short, quasar-like "AGN" events whose feedback does affect galaxies. This makes classical bulges and coreless-rotating ellipticals. 3- At the highest BH masses, maintenance-mode feedback into X-ray gas has the negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating ellipticals. They inherit coevolution magic from smaller progenitors. 4- Independent of any feedback physics, the averaging that results from successive mergers helps to engineer tight BH correlations.},

  abstract = {Scattering amplitudes have their origin in quantum field theory, but have wide-ranging applications extending to classical physics. We review a formalism to connect certain classical observables to scattering amplitudes. An advantage of this formalism is that it enables us to study implications of the double copy in classical gravity. We discuss examples of observables including the total change of a particle's momentum, and the gravitational waveform, during a scattering encounter. The double copy also allows direct access to classical solutions in gravity. We review this classical double copy starting from its linearised level, where it originates in the double copy of three-point amplitudes. The classical double copy extends elegantly to exact solutions, making a connection between scattering amplitudes and the geometric formulation of General Relativity.},

  abstract = {We describe a new method of calculation of generic multi-loop master integrals based on the numerical solution of systems of difference equations in one variable. We show algorithms for the construction of the systems using integration-by-parts identities and methods of solutions by means of expansions in factorial series and Laplace's transformation. We also describe new algorithms for the identification of master integrals and the reduction of generic Feynman integrals to master integrals, and procedures for generating and solving systems of differential equations in masses and momenta for master integrals. We apply our method to the calculation of the master integrals of massive vacuum and self-energy diagrams up to three loops and of massive vertex and box diagrams up to two loops. Implementation in a computer program of our approach is described. Important features of the implementation are: the ability to deal with hundreds of master integrals and the ability to obtain very high precision results expanded at will in the number of dimensions.},

  abstract = {This book is an introductory graduate-level textbook on the theory of smooth manifolds. Its goal is to familiarize students with the tools they will need in order to use manifolds in mathematical or scientific research--- smooth structures, tangent vectors and covectors, vector bundles, immersed and embedded submanifolds, tensors, differential forms, de Rham cohomology, vector fields, flows, foliations, Lie derivatives, Lie groups, Lie algebras, and more. The approach is as concrete as possible, with pictures and intuitive discussions of how one should think geometrically about the abstract concepts, while making full use of the powerful tools that modern mathematics has to offer.This second edition has been extensively revised and clarified, and the topics have been substantially rearranged. The book now introduces the two most important analytic tools, the rank theorem and the fundamental theorem on flows, much earlier so that they can be used throughout the book. A few new topics have been added, notably Sard's theorem and transversality, a proof that infinitesimal Lie group actions generate global group actions, a more thorough study of first-order partial differential equations, a brief treatment of degree theory for smooth maps between compact manifolds, and an introduction to contact structures.Prerequisites include a solid acquaintance with general topology, the fundamental group, and covering spaces, as well as basic undergraduate linear algebra and real analysis.},

In this chapter we show how to define vector fields on smooth manifolds, as certain kinds of maps from the manifold to its tangent bundle. Then we introduce the Lie bracket operation, which is a way of combining two smooth vector fields to obtain another. The most important application of Lie brackets is to Lie groups: the set of all smooth vector fields on a Lie group that are invariant under left multiplication is closed under Lie brackets, and thus forms an algebraic object naturally associated with the group, called the Lie algebra of the Lie group. We show how Lie group homomorphisms induce homomorphisms of their Lie algebras, from which it follows that isomorphic Lie groups have isomorphic Lie algebras.},

The space of all covectors at p{$\in$}M is a vector space called the cotangent space at p; in linear-algebraic terms, it is the dual space to T p M. The union of all cotangent spaces at all points of M is a vector bundle called the cotangent bundle. Whereas tangent vectors give us a coordinate-free interpretation of derivatives of curves, it turns out that derivatives of real-valued functions on a manifold are most naturally interpreted as tangent covectors. Thus we define the differential of a real-valued function as a covector field (a smooth section of the cotangent bundle); it is a coordinate-independent analogue of the gradient. In the second half of the chapter we introduce line integrals of covector fields, which satisfy a far-reaching generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus.},

This leads to the concepts of tensors and tensor fields on manifolds.

In order to make sense of calculus on manifolds, we need to introduce the tangent space to a manifold at a point, which we can think of as a sort of ``linear model'' for the manifold near the point. Motivated by the fact that vectors in {$\mathbb{R}$} n act on smooth functions by taking their directional derivatives, we define a tangent vector to a smooth manifold to be a linear map from the space of smooth functions on the manifold to {$\mathbb{R}$} that satisfies a certain product rule. After defining tangent vectors, we show how a smooth map between manifolds yields a linear map between tangent spaces, called the differential of the map, and a smooth curve determines a tangent vector at each point, called its velocity. In the final two sections we discuss and compare several other approaches to defining tangent spaces, and give a brief overview of the terminology of category theory, which puts the tangent space and differentials in a larger context.},

Smooth immersions and embeddings, as we will see in the next chapter, are essential ingredients in the theory of submanifolds, while smooth submersions play a role in smooth manifold theory closely analogous to the role played by quotient maps in topology. The engine that powers this discussion is the rank theorem, a corollary of the inverse function theorem, which we prove in the first section of the chapter.

Manifolds in which it is possible to choose a consistent orientation are said to be orientable. After defining orientations, we treat the special case of orientations on Riemannian manifolds and Riemannian hypersurfaces. At the end of the chapter, we explore the close relationship between orientability and covering maps.

Given a smooth subbundle of the tangent bundle of M, called a distribution on M, we can ask whether there are k-dimensional submanifolds (called integral manifolds of the distribution) whose tangent spaces at each point are the given subspaces of the tangent bundle. The answer in this case is more complicated than in the case of vector fields: there is a nontrivial necessary condition, called involutivity, that must be satisfied by the distribution. The main theorem of this chapter, the Frobenius theorem, tells us that involutivity is also sufficient for the existence of an integral manifold through each point. At the end of the chapter, we give applications of the theory to Lie groups and to partial differential equations.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, we begin to develop the theory of differential forms, which are alternating tensor fields on manifolds. It might come as a surprise, but these innocent-sounding objects turn out to be considerably more important in smooth manifold theory than symmetric tensor fields, because they provide a framework for generalizing a variety of concepts from multivariable calculus. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the main tools for manipulating differential forms. The most important such tool is the exterior derivative, which generalizes the differential of a smooth function that we introduced in Chapter 11, as well as the gradient, divergence, and curl operators of multivariable calculus. At the end of the chapter, we will see how the exterior derivative can be used to simplify the computation of Lie derivatives of differential forms.},

  abstract = {In Chapter 14, we defined closed and exact differential forms, and showed that every exact form is closed. In this chapter, we explore the converse question: Is every closed form exact? The answer is locally yes, but globally no. The question of which closed forms are exact depends on subtle topological properties of the manifold, connected with the existence of ``holes'' of various dimensions. Making this dependence quantitative leads to a new set of invariants of smooth manifolds, called the de Rham cohomology groups, which are the subject of this chapter. They are easily shown to be diffeomorphism invariants, but surprisingly they turn out also to be topological invariants. We prove a general theorem, called the Mayer\textendash Vietoris theorem, that expresses the de Rham groups of a manifold in terms of those of its open subsets. Using it, we compute the de Rham groups of spheres and the top-degree groups of compact manifolds, and give a brief introduction to degree theory for maps between compact manifolds of the same dimension.},

  abstract = {A new formulation of quantized field theories is proposed. Starting from some general requirements we derive a set of equations which determine the matrix-elements of field operators and the S-Matrix. These equations contain no renormalization constants, but only experimental masses and coupling parameters. The main advantage over the conventional formulation is thus the elimination of all divergent terms in the basic equations. This means that no renormalization problem arises. The formulation is here restricted to theories which do not involve stable bound states. For simplicity we derive the equations for spin 0 particles, however the extension to other cases (e.g. quantum electrodynamics) is obvious. The solutions of the equations are discussed in a power-series expansion. They are then identical with the renormalized expressions of the conventional formulation. However, the equations set up here are not restricted to the application of perturbation theory.},

  abstract = {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of \$1.0 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-21\}\$. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1 \{\textbackslash sigma\}. The source lies at a luminosity distance of \$410\^\{+160\}\_\{-180\}\$ Mpc corresponding to a redshift \$z = 0.09\^\{+0.03\}\_\{-0.04\}\$. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are \$36\^\{+5\}\_\{-4\} M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$29\^\{+4\}\_\{-4\} M\_\textbackslash odot\$, and the final black hole mass is \$62\^\{+4\}\_\{-4\} M\_\textbackslash odot\$, with \$3.0\^\{+0.5\}\_\{-0.5\} M\_\textbackslash odot c\^2\$ radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90\% credible intervals.These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.},

  abstract = {On August 17, 2017 at 12:41:04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron star inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per \$8.0\textbackslash times10\^4\$ years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$, in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17 to 1.60 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$, with the total mass of the system \$2.74\^\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.01\}\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$. The source was localized within a sky region of 28 deg\$\^2\$ (90\% probability) and had a luminosity distance of \$40\^\{+8\}\_\{-14\}\$ Mpc, the closest and most precisely localized gravitational-wave signal yet. The association with the gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence, corroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first direct evidence of a link between these mergers and short gamma-ray bursts. Subsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic spectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event as a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter, gravitation and cosmology.},

  abstract = {We report the observation of gravitational waves from two compact binary coalescences in LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run with properties consistent with neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries. The two events are named GW200105\_162426 and GW200115\_042309, abbreviated as GW200105 and GW200115; the first was observed by LIGO Livingston and Virgo, and the second by all three LIGO-Virgo detectors. The source of GW200105 has component masses \$8.9\^\{+1.2\}\_\{-1.5\}\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$1.9\^\{+0.3\}\_\{-0.2\}\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$, whereas the source of GW200115 has component masses \$5.7\^\{+1.8\}\_\{-2.1\}\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$1.5\^\{+0.7\}\_\{-0.3\}\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$ (all measurements quoted at the 90\% credible level). The probability that the secondary's mass is below the maximal mass of a neutron star is 89\%-96\% and 87\%-98\%, respectively, for GW200105 and GW200115, with the ranges arising from different astrophysical assumptions. The source luminosity distances are \$280\^\{+110\}\_\{-110\}\$ Mpc and \$300\^\{+150\}\_\{-100\}\$ Mpc, respectively. The magnitude of the primary spin of GW200105 is less than 0.23 at the 90\% credible level, and its orientation is unconstrained. For GW200115, the primary spin has a negative spin projection onto the orbital angular momentum at 88\% probability. We are unable to constrain spin or tidal deformation of the secondary component for either event. We infer a NSBH merger rate density of \$45\^\{+75\}\_\{-33\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{Gpc\}\^\{-3\} \textbackslash mathrm\{yr\}\^\{-1\}\$ when assuming GW200105 and GW200115 are representative of the NSBH population, or \$130\^\{+112\}\_\{-69\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{Gpc\}\^\{-3\} \textbackslash mathrm\{yr\}\^\{-1\}\$ under the assumption of a broader distribution of component masses.},

  abstract = {Building upon the worldline effective field theory (EFT) formalism for spinning bodies developed for the Post-Newtonian regime, we generalize the EFT approach to Post-Minkowskian (PM) dynamics to include rotational degrees of freedom in a manifestly covariant framework. We introduce a systematic procedure to compute the total change in momentum and spin in the gravitational scattering of compact objects. For the special case of spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum, we show how to construct the radial action for elliptic-like orbits using the Boundary-to-Bound correspondence. As a paradigmatic example, we solve the scattering problem to next-to-leading PM order with linear and bilinear spin effects and arbitrary initial conditions, incorporating for the first time finite-size corrections. We obtain the aligned-spin radial action from the resulting scattering data, and derive the periastron advance and binding energy for circular orbits. We also provide the (square of the) center-of-mass momentum to \$\{\textbackslash cal O\}(G\^2)\$, which may be used to reconstruct a Hamiltonian. Our results are in perfect agreement with the existent literature, while at the same time extend the knowledge of the PM dynamics of compact binaries at quadratic order in spins.},

  abstract = {Compact object binaries formed from dynamics interactions will generically have non-zero orbital eccentricity. The gravitational waves from such binaries can change drastically depending on how large the eccentricity is, ranging from emitted in small a subset of orbital harmonics at low eccentricities, to being concentrated into intense bursts of radiation from each pericenter passage at large eccentricities. Gravitational waves from such highly eccentric binaries present themselves an intriguing systems for probing fundamental physics, but also present interesting challenges in terms of detection. The presence of orbital eccentricity in the gravitational wave signature gives an unequivocal method of determining the origin of the binary, while the highly dynamical nature of pericenter passage often enhances the physics associated with matter and gravity. The generation of faithful models of the repeated burst signals has proven challenging, and often sub-optimal detection strategies like power stacking are considered for detection. This chapter reviews our current understanding of eccentric binaries, the leading efforts to model their gravitational wave emission, and the physics that can be probed with these detections.},

A greatly more sensitive third generation of observatories is currently being planned: The Einstein Telescope in Europe and Cosmic Explorer in the USA. The Einstein Telescope is envisaged as an underground observatory in the shape of an equilateral triangle with a side length of 10 km located in Europe. Cosmic Explorer, on the other hand, aims for two above-ground L-shaped detectors with up to 40 -km-long arms in the USA. These detectors will be capable of observing the post-merger phase of neutron star mergers, detecting a large fraction of all of the stellar mass binary black hole (BH) mergers in the universe \textendash{} including some with incredible precision, and of mapping the stellar evolution of the universe. These projects are currently in the design stage and are expected to start operations around the mid-2030s. The concepts are slightly different but have many technical similarities.},

  abstract = {The largest part of any gravitational-wave inspiral of a compact binary can be understood as a slow, adiabatic drift between the trajectories of a certain referential conservative system. In many contexts, the phase space of this conservative system is smooth and there are no "topological transitions" in the phase space, meaning that there are no sudden qualitative changes in the character of the orbital motion during the inspiral. However, in this chapter we discuss the cases where this assumption fails and non-linear and/or non-smooth transitions come into play. In integrable conservative systems under perturbation, topological transitions suddenly appear at resonances, and we sketch how to implement the passage through such regions in an inspiral model. Even though many of the developments of this chapter apply to general inspirals, we focus on a particular scenario known as the Extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI). An EMRI consists of a compact stellar-mass object inspiralling into a supermassive black hole. At leading order, the referential conservative system is simply geodesic motion in the field of the supermassive black hole and the rate of the drift is given by radiation reaction. In Einstein gravity the supermassive black hole field is the Kerr space-time in which the geodesic motion is integrable. However, the equations of motion can be perturbed in various ways so that prolonged resonances and chaos appear in phase space as well as the inspiral, which we demonstrate in simple physically motivated examples.},

In particular, pulsar timing arrays make use of a set of extremely well-timed pulsars and their time correlations as a challenging detector of gravitational waves. It turns out that pulsar timing arrays are particularly sensitive to ultra-low-frequency gravitational waves, which makes them complementary to other gravitational-wave detectors. Here, we summarize the basics, focusing especially on supermassive black-hole binaries and cosmic strings, which have the potential to form a stochastic gravitational-wave background in the pulsar timing array detection band, and the scientific goals on this challenging topic. We also briefly outline the recent interesting results of the main pulsar timing array collaborations, which have found strong evidence of a common-spectrum process compatible with a stochastic gravitationalwave background and mention some new perspectives that are particularly interesting in view of the forthcoming radio observatories such as the Five hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, the MeerKAT telescope, and the Square Kilometer Array.},

In this review, we discuss the main formation channels of BBHs from stellar evolution and dynamics. Uncertainties on massive star evolution (e.g., stellar winds, rotation, overshooting and nuclear reaction rates), core-collapse supernovae and pair instability still hamper our comprehension of the mass spectrum and spin distribution of black holes (BHs), but substantial progress has been done in the field over the last few years. On top of this, the efficiency of mass transfer in a binary system and the physics of common envelope substantially affect the final BBH demography. Dynamical processes in dense stellar systems can trigger the formation of BHs in the mass gap and intermediate-mass BHs via hierarchical BH mergers and via multiple stellar collisions. Finally, we discuss the importance of reconstructing the cosmic evolution of BBHs.},

  abstract = {This article aims at discussing the cosmological constant problem at a pedagogical but fully technical level. We review how the vacuum energy can be regularized in flat and curved space\textendash time and how it can be understood in terms of Feynman bubble diagrams. In particular, we show that the properly renormalized value of the zero-point energy density today (for a free theory) is in fact far from being 122 orders of magnitude larger than the critical energy density, as often quoted in the literature. We mainly consider the case of scalar fields but also treat the cases of fermions and gauge bosons which allows us to discuss the question of vacuum energy in super-symmetry. Then, we discuss how the cosmological constant can be measured in cosmology and constrained with experiments such as measurements of planet orbits in our solar system or atomic spectra. We also review why the Lamb shift and the Casimir effect seem to indicate that the quantum zero-point fluctuations are not an artifact of the quantum field theory formalism. We investigate how experiments on the universality of free fall can constrain the gravitational properties of vacuum energy and we discuss the status of the weak equivalence principle in quantum mechanics, in particular the Colella, Overhauser and Werner experiment and the quantum Galileo experiment performed with a Salecker\textendash Wigner\textendash Peres clock. Finally, we briefly conclude with a discussion on the solutions to the cosmological constant problem that have been proposed so far. R\'esum\'e Cet article traite du probl\`eme de la constante cosmologique d'une mani\`ere p\'edagogique aussi bien que technique. Nous passons en revue comment l'\'energie du vide peut \^etre r\'egularis\'ee en espace temps plat et courbe, et comment son calcul peut \^etre compris en termes de diagrammes de Feynman en bulles. En particulier, nous montrons que la valeur correctement renormalis\'ee de l'\'energie de point z\'ero maintenant (pour une th\'eorie libre) en en fait bien au dessous des 122 ordres de grandeur de l'\'energie critique de l'univers. Nous nous concentrons sur le cas des champs scalaires bien que nous consid\'erions le cas des fermions et des bosons de jauge \'egalement afin de traiter l'\'energie du vide en supersym\'etrie. Nous discutons aussi comment la constante cosmologique peut \^etre mesur\'ee cosmologiquement et contrainte par la mesure de l'orbite des plan\`etes du syst\`eme solaire ou encore des spectres atomiques. Nous passons aussi en revue pourquoi la mesure du Lamb shift et de l'effet Casimir semblent indiquer que les fluctuations quantiques de l'\'energie du vide ne sont pas un artefact du formalisme de la th\'eorie des champs.

This authoritative text has shaped the research of generations of physicists and astronomers, and the book continues to influence the way experts think about the subject.With an emphasis on geometric interpretation, this masterful and comprehensive book introduces the theory of relativity; describes physical applications, from stars to black holes and gravitational waves; and portrays the field's frontiers. The book also offers a unique, alternating, two-track pathway through the subject. Material focusing on basic physical ideas is designated as Track 1 and formulates an appropriate one-semester graduate-level course. The remaining Track 2 material provides a wealth of advanced topics instructors can draw on for a two-semester course, with Track 1 sections serving as prerequisites.This must-have reference for students and scholars of relativity includes a new preface by David Kaiser, reflecting on the history of the book's publication and reception, and a new introduction by Charles Misner and Kip Thorne, discussing exciting developments in the field since the book's original publication.The book teaches students to:Grasp the laws of physics in flat and curved spacetimePredict orders of magnitudeCalculate using the principal tools of modern geometryUnderstand Einstein's geometric framework for physicsExplore applications, including neutron stars, Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, gravitational collapse, gravitational waves, cosmology, and so much more},

To calculate expectation values in the WQFT a new set of Feynman rules is introduced which treats the gravitational field \$h\_\{\textbackslash mu\textbackslash nu\}(x)\$ and position \$x\_i\^\textbackslash mu(\textbackslash tau\_i)\$ of each black hole on equal footing. Using these both the next-order classical gravitational radiation \$\textbackslash langle h\^\{\textbackslash mu\textbackslash nu\}(k)\textbackslash rangle\$ (previously unknown) and deflection \$\textbackslash Delta p\_i\^\textbackslash mu\$ from a binary black hole scattering event are obtained. The latter can also be obtained from the eikonal phase of a \$2\textbackslash to2\$ scalar S-matrix, which we show to correspond to the free energy of the WQFT.},

In particular, we begin surveying some basic notions of potential scattering such as transfer matrix and its analyticity, multi-delta-function and locally periodic potentials, Jost solutions, spectral singularities and their time-reversal, and unidirectional reflectionlessness and invisibility. We then offer a simple derivation of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation and Born series, and discuss the Born approximation. Next, we outline a recently developed dynamical formulation of time-independent scattering theory in one dimension. This formulation relates the transfer matrix and therefore the solution of the scattering problem for a given potential to the solution of the time-dependent Schr\textbackslash "odinger equation for an effective non-unitary two-level quantum system. We provide a self-contained treatment of this formulation and some of its most important applications. Specifically, we use it to devise a powerful alternative to the Born series and Born approximation, derive dynamical equations for the reflection and transmission amplitudes, discuss their application in constructing exact tunable unidirectionally invisible potentials, and use them to provide an exact solution for single-mode inverse scattering problems. The latter, which has important applications in designing optical devices with a variety of functionalities, amounts to providing an explicit construction for a finite-range complex potential whose reflection and transmission amplitudes take arbitrary prescribed values at any given wavenumber.},

Here we explore the possibility of detection of GWs from hyperbolic interactions of compact stars with ground-based interferometric detectors. It is believed that a bound compact cluster, such as a globular cluster, can be a primary environment for these interactions. We estimate the detection rates for such events by considering local geometry within the cluster, accounting for scattering probability of compact stars at finite distances, and assuming realistic cluster properties guided by available numerical models, their formation times, and evolution of stars inside them. We find that, even in the conservative limit, it may be possible to detect such black hole encounters in the next few years by the present network of observatories with the ongoing sensitivity upgrades and one to few events per year with the next generation observatories. In practice, actual detection rates can significantly surpass the estimated average rates, since the chances of finding outliers in a very large population can be high. Such observations (or, no observation) may provide crucial constraints to estimate the number of isolated compact stars in the universe. These detections will be exciting discoveries on their own and will be complimentary to observations of binary mergers bringing us one step closer to address a fundamental question, how many black holes are there in the observable universe.},

As an explicit example we derive the Schwarzchild space-time as a series in \$G\_N\$. At no point of the derivation is any use made of the Einstein-Hilbert action or the Einstein equations. The intermediate steps involve only on-shell S-matrix elements which are generated via BCFW recursion relations and unitarity sewing techniques. The notion of a space-time metric is only introduced at the end of the calculation where it is extracted by matching the potential determined by the S-matrix to the geodesic motion of a test particle. Other static space-times such as Kerr follow in a similar manner. Furthermore, given that the procedure is action independent and depends only upon the choice of the representation of the little group, solutions to Yang-Mills (YM) theory can be generated in the same fashion. Moreover, the squaring relation between the YM and gravity three point functions shows that the seeds that generate solutions in the two theories are algebraically related. From a technical standpoint our methodology can also be utilized to calculate quantities relevant for the binary inspiral problem more efficiently than the more traditional Feynman diagram approach.},

Motivated by a recent result for universality in massless scattering, we compare the scattering angle to the result found by Bern et. al. in Einstein gravity and find that they coincide in the high-energy limit, suggesting graviton dominance at this order.},

A spanning tree is grown and the vertices examined in turn, unexamined vertices being stored in a pushdown list to await examination. One stage in the process is to take the top element v of the pushdown list and examine it, i.e. inspect all those edges (v, z) of the graph for which z has not yet been examined. If z is already in the tree, a fundamental cycle is added; if not, the edge (v, z) is placed in the tree. There is exactly one such stage for each of the n vertices of the graph. For large n, the store required increases as n2 and the time as n{$\gamma$} where {$\gamma$} depends on the type of graph involved. {$\gamma$} is bounded below by 2 and above by 3, and it is shown that both bounds are attained. In terms of storage our algorithm is similar to that of Gotlieb and Corneil and superior to that of Welch; in terms of speed it is similar to that of Welch and superior to that of Gotlieb and Corneil. Tests show our algorithm to be remarkably efficient ({$\gamma$} = 2) on random graphs.},

We call such structures "acsets," short for "attributed \$\textbackslash mathsf\{C\}\$-sets." Derived from previous work on algebraic databases, acsets are a joint generalization of graphs and data frames. They also encompass more elaborate graph-like objects such as wiring diagrams and Petri nets with rate constants.

  abstract = {The merger of two neutron stars or of a neutron star and a black hole often result in the ejection of a few percents of a solar mass of matter expanding at high speed in space. Being matter coming from the violent disruption of a neutron star, these ejecta are initially very dense, hot and extremely rich in neutrons. The few available protons form heavy nuclei ("seeds") that absorb the more abundant free neutrons, increasing their size. The neutron density is so high that a substantial number of neutron captures occur before the resulting unstable nuclei can decay toward more stable configurations, converting neutrons into protons. Depending mostly on the initial neutron richness, this mechanism leads to the formation of up to half of the heavy elements that we observe in nature and it is called rapid neutron capture process ("\$r\$-process"). The prediction of the precise composition of the ejecta requires a detailed knowledge of the properties of very exotic nuclei, that have never been produced in a laboratory. Despite having long been a speculative scenario, nowadays several observational evidences point to compact binary mergers as one of the major sites where heavy elements are formed in the Universe. The most striking one was the detection of a kilonova following the merger of a neutron star binary: the light emitted by this astronomical transient is indeed powered by the radioactive decay of freshly synthesized neutron-rich nuclei and testifies the actual nature of compact binary mergers as cosmic forges.},

  abstract = {Much of the success of gravitational-wave astronomy rests on perturbation theory. Historically, perturbative analysis of gravitational-wave sources has largely focused on post-Newtonian theory. However, strong-field perturbation theory is essential in many cases such as the quasinormal ringdown following the merger of a binary system, tidally perturbed compact objects, and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. In this review, motivated primarily by small-mass-ratio binaries but not limited to them, we provide an overview of essential methods in (i) black hole perturbation theory, (ii) orbital mechanics in Kerr spacetime, and (iii) gravitational self-force theory. Our treatment of black hole perturbation theory covers most common methods, including the Teukolsky and Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations, methods of metric reconstruction, and Lorenz-gauge formulations, presenting them in a new consistent and self-contained form. Our treatment of orbital mechanics covers quasi-Keplerian and action-angle descriptions of bound geodesics and accelerated orbits, osculating geodesics, near-identity averaging transformations, multiscale expansions, and orbital resonances. Our summary of self-force theory's foundations is brief, covering the main ideas and results of matched asymptotic expansions, local expansion methods, puncture schemes, and point particle descriptions. We conclude by combining the above methods in a multiscale expansion of the perturbative Einstein equations, leading to adiabatic and post-adiabatic evolution schemes. Our presentation is intended primarily as a reference for practitioners but includes a variety of new results. In particular, we present the first complete post-adiabatic waveform-generation framework for generic (nonresonant) orbits in Kerr.},

As an example we show results from the evolution of a binary composed of two equal mass, non-spinning black holes, through a single plunge-orbit, merger and ring down. The resultant black hole is estimated to be a Kerr black hole with angular momentum parameter a\textasciitilde 0.70. At present, lack of resolution far from the binary prevents an accurate estimate of the energy emitted, though a rough calculation suggests on the order of 5\% of the initial rest mass of the system is radiated as gravitational waves during the final orbit and ringdown.},

  abstract = {We consider the calculation of the master integrals of the three-loop massive banana graph. In the case of equal internal masses, the graph is reduced to three master integrals which satisfy an irreducible system of three coupled linear differential equations. The solution of the system requires finding a 3\texttimes 3 matrix of homogeneous solutions. We show how the maximal cut can be used to determine all entries of this matrix in terms of products of elliptic integrals of first and second kind of suitable arguments. All independent solutions are found by performing the integration which defines the maximal cut on different contours. Once the homogeneous solution is known, the inhomogeneous solution can be obtained by use of Euler's variation of constants.},

It is shown in this paper that the integration by part identities can be further used for obtaining a linear system of first order differential equations for the master integrals themselves. The equations can then be used for the numerical evaluation of the amplitudes as well as for investigating their analytic properties, such as the asymptotic and threshold behaviours and the corresponding expansions (and for analytic integration purposes, when possible). The new method is illustrated through its somewhat detailed application to the case of the one loop self-mass amplitude, by explicitly working out expansions and quadrature formulas, both in arbitrary continuous dimension n and in the n \textrightarrow{} 4 limit. It is then shortly discussed which features of the new method are expected to work in the more general case of multi-point, multi-loop amplitudes.},

The total emitted momentum is obtained by phase-space integration of the graviton momentum weighted by the modulo squared of the radiation amplitude. We recast this as a two-loop integral that we solve using techniques borrowed from particle physics, such as reverse unitarity, reduction to master integrals by integration-by-parts identities and canonical differential equations. The emitted momentum agrees with recent results obtained by other methods. Our approach provides an alternative way of directly computing radiated observables in the post-Minkowskian expansion without going through the classical limit of scattering amplitudes.},

The post-Newtonian computations of the explicit analytic dynamics and motion of compact binaries are discussed within the most often applied Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism. The obtention of autonomous Hamiltonians is achieved by the transition to Routhians. Order reduction of higher derivative Hamiltonians results in standard Hamiltonians. Tetrad representation of general relativity is introduced for the tackling of compact binaries with spinning components. Configurations are treated where the absolute values of the spin vectors can be considered constant. Compact objects are modeled by use of Dirac delta functions and their derivatives. Consistency is achieved through transition to d-dimensional space and application of dimensional regularization. At the fourth post-Newtonian level, tail contributions to the binding energy show up. The conservative spin-dependent dynamics finds explicit presentation in Hamiltonian form through next-to-next-to-leading-order spin-orbit and spin1-spin2 couplings and to leading-order in the cubic and quartic in spin interactions. The radiation reaction dynamics is presented explicitly through the third-and-half post-Newtonian order for spinless objects, and, for spinning bodies, to leading-order in the spin-orbit and spin1-spin2 couplings. The most important historical issues get pointed out.},

Our chosen setting is suitable for infinite-dimensional diagrammatic reasoning, generalising the ZX calculus and other algebraic gadgets familiar to the categorical quantum theory community. The Feynman diagrams we define look very similar to their traditional counterparts, but are more general: instead of depicting scattering amplitude, they embody the linear maps from which the amplitudes themselves are computed, for any given initial and final particle states. This shift in perspective reflects into a formal transition from the syntactic, graph-theoretic compositionality of traditional Feynman diagrams to a semantic, categorical-diagrammatic compositionality. Because we work in a concrete categorical setting -- powered by non-standard analysis -- we are able to take direct advantage of complex additive structure in our description. This makes it possible to derive a particularly compelling characterisation for the sequential composition of categorical Feynman diagrams, which automatically results in the superposition of all possible graph-theoretic combinations of the individual diagrams themselves.},

In this chapter, we review the highest energy counterparts of GW sources detectable by current-generation GW interferometers: this include high-energy photons, neutrinos, and cosmic rays. They are expected from the disruption of the GW progenitor, produced in the accretion of matter and its relativistic ejection during the final coalescence phase. The detection of high-energy neutrinos and cosmic rays requires large-volume detectors, while high-energy gamma rays are observed by means of satellites and ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. We briefly introduce them along with the recent advances in the identification of the neutrino and gamma-ray counterparts of GW. We detail the complementary information we can get observing astrophysical sources with these messengers; we describe the strategies currently used to follow up GWs, the observational status, and the prospects for the next years.},

The gravitational wave detections from compact binary coalescences will demand even more accurate description of the source dynamics as the sensitivity of detectors increases over years. The analytic modeling of classical gravitational dynamics has been enriched over the last decade of powerful methods borrowed from field theory originally developed to describe fundamental particle quantum scatterings. This work aims at presenting a review of a specific effort, initiated by the seminal paper by Goldberger and Rothstein, dubbed nonrelativistic general relativity, which applies effective field theory methods to describe the two-body dynamics in general relativity. It models the classical interaction between astrophysically massive objects via field theory methods, showing that many features usually associated with quantum field theory, e.g., divergences and counter-terms, renormalization group, loop expansions, and Feynman diagrams, have all to do with field theory, be it quantum or classical.},

One of these predictions, the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background from the early universe, has not been tested yet and represents one of the major challenges and opportunities for future research. In this chapter, we provide a brief theoretical overview of the mechanism underlying gravitational wave production during inflation. We explain how the detection of inflationary gravitational waves can provide invaluable information on the physics driving inflation, as well as on aspects of high-energy physics and gravity at the highest energy scales. In particular, we discuss how different realizations of inflation \textendash{} from single-field inflation to more sophisticated scenarios motivated from high-energy physics \textendash{} lead to distinctive properties for the gravitational wave background they produce. Given the future prospects on the observational and experimental side of gravitational wave physics, a detailed theoretical analysis of these properties will be essential for a correct interpretation of data. The theoretical ideas we discuss here aim to provide a general orientation on well-motivated physical effects from the early universe, to be searched for with experiments aimed to detect a stochastic background of gravitational waves.},

  abstract = {This paper brings together, into a single unified notation, the multipole formalisms for gravitational radiation which various people have constructed. It also extends the results of previous workers. More specifically: Part One of this paper reviews the various scalar, vector, and tensor spherical harmonics used in the general relativity literature\textemdash including the Regge-Wheeler harmonics, the symmetric, trace-free ("STF") tensors of Sachs and Pirani, the Newman-Penrose spin-weighted harmonics, and the Mathews-Zerilli Clebsch-Gordan-coupled harmonics\textemdash which include "pure-orbital" harmonics and "pure-spin" harmonics. The relationships between the various harmonics are presented. Part One then turns attention to gravitational radiation. The concept of "local wave zone" is introduced to facilitate a clean separation of "wave generation" from "wave propagation." The generic radiation field in the local wave zone is decomposed into multipole components. The energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum in the waves are expressed as infinite sums of multipole contributions. Attention is then restricted to sources that admit a nonsingular, spacetime-covering de Donder coordinate system. (This excludes black holes.) In such a coordinate system the multipole moments of the radiation field are expressed as volume integrals over the source. For slow-motion systems, these source integrals are re-expressed as infinite power series in L{$\lambda\equiv$}(sizeofsource)(reducedwavelengthofwaves). The slow-motion source integrals are then specialized to systems with weak internal gravity to yield (i) the standard Newtonian formulas for the multipole moments, (ii) the post-Newtonian formulas of Epstein and Wagoner, and (iii) post-post-Newtonian formulas. Part Two of this paper derives a multipole-moment wave-generation formalism for slow-motion systems with arbitrarily strong internal gravity, including systems that cannot be covered by de Donder coordinates. In this formalism one calculates, by any means, the source's instantaneous, near-zone, external gravitational field as a solution of the time-independent Einstein field equations. One then reads off of this near-zone field the source's instantaneous multipole moments; and one plugs those time-evolving moments into the standard radiation formulae given in Part One of this paper. As building blocks for this formalism, Part Two also does the following things: (1) In the linearized theory of gravity, for the vacuum exterior of an isolated system, it derives the general solution of the field equations (a result due to Sachs, Bergmann, and Pirani). (2) In full nonlinear general relativity, for the vacuum near-zone exterior of an isolated system, it derives the structure of the general solution of the Einstein field equations. That structure is expressed as a sum of products of multipole contributions. It also matches this near-zone field onto an outgoing-wave radiation field. (3) In full nonlinear general relativity, for the vacuum exterior of a stationary isolated system, (a) it presents a definition of multipole moments which meshes naturally with gravitational-wave theory; (b) it introduces the concept of "asymptotically Cartesian and mass centered" (ACMC) coordinate systems; and (c) it shows how to deduce the multipole moments of a source from the form of its metric in an ACMC coordinate system. As an example, the lowest few (l{$\leq$}3) multipole moments of the Kerr metric are computed.},

  abstract = {Manifolds, the higher-dimensional analogues of smooth curves and surfaces, are fundamental objects in modern mathematics. Combining aspects of algebra, topology, and analysis, manifolds have also been applied to classical mechanics, general relativity, and quantum field theory. In this streamlined introduction to the subject, the theory of manifolds is presented with the aim of helping the reader achieve a rapid mastery of the essential topics. By the end of the book the reader should be able to compute, at least for simple spaces, one of the most basic topological invariants of a manifold, its de Rham cohomology. Along the way the reader acquires the knowledge and skills necessary for further study of geometry and topology. The second edition contains fifty pages of new material. Many passages have been rewritten, proofs simplified, and new examples and exercises added. This work may be used as a textbook for a one-semester graduate or advanced undergraduate course, as well as by students engaged in self-study. The requisite point-set topology is included in an appendix of twenty-five pages; other appendices review facts from real analysis and linear algebra. Hints and solutions are provided to many of the exercises and problems. Requiring only minimal undergraduate prerequisites, "An Introduction to Manifolds" is also an excellent foundation for the author's publication with Raoul Bott, "Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology."},

  abstract = {We utilize generalized unitarity and recursion relations combined with effective field theory(EFT) techniques to compute spin dependent interaction terms for inspiralling binary systems in the post newtonian(PN) approximation. Using these methods offers great computational advantage over traditional techniques involving feynman diagrams, especially at higher orders in the PN expansion. As a specific example, we reproduce the spin-orbit interaction up to 2.5 PN order as also the leading order \$S\^2\$(3PN) hamiltonian for an arbitrary massive object. We also obtain the unknown \$S\^3\$(3.5PN) spin hamiltonian for an arbitrary massive object in terms of its low frequency linear response to gravitational perturbations, which was till now known only for a black hole. Furthermore, we derive the missing \$S\^4\$ Hamiltonian at leading order(4PN) for an arbitrary massive object and establish that a minimal coupling of a massive elementary particle to gravity leads to a black hole structure. Finally, the Kerr metric is obtained as a series in \$G\_N\$ by comparing the action of a test particle in the vicinity of a spinning black hole to the derived potential.},

Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) use sets of extremely well-timed pulsars as a Galaxy-scale detector with arms extending between Earth and each pulsar in the array. These challenging experiments look for correlated deviations in the pulsars' timing that are caused by low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) traversing our Galaxy. PTAs are particularly sensitive to GWs at nanohertz frequencies, which makes them complementary to other space- and ground-based detectors. In this chapter, we will describe the methodology behind pulsar timing; provide an overview of the potential uses of PTAs; and summarise where current PTA-based detection efforts stand. Most predictions expect PTAs to successfully detect a cosmological background of GWs emitted by supermassive black-hole binaries and also potentially detect continuous-wave emission from binary supermassive black holes, within the next several years.},

Here, for BH spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum, we propose a simple extension of that mapping to 2PM order. We provide evidence for the validity and utility of this 2PM mapping by demonstrating its compatibility with all known analytical results for the conservative local-in-time dynamics of binary BHs in the post-Newtonian (weak-field and slow-motion) approximation and, separately, in the test-BH limit. Our result could be employed in the construction of improved effective-one-body models for the conservative dynamics of inspiraling spinning binary BHs.},

What are the properties of these populations? As the detection of gravitational waves is becoming routine and the size of the event catalog increases, finer and finer details of the astrophysical distribution of compact binaries are now within our grasp. This Chapter presents a pedagogical introduction to the main statistical tool required for these analyses: hierarchical Bayesian inference in the presence of selection effects. All key equations are obtained from first principles, followed by two examples of increasing complexity. Although many remarks made in this Chapter refer to gravitational-wave astronomy, the write-up is generic enough to be useful to researchers and graduate students from other fields.},

With the right language, many methods from the genus zero case carry over to the genus one case. In particular we will see in specific examples that the differential equation for elliptic Feynman integrals can be cast into an \$\textbackslash varepsilon\$-form. This allows to systematically obtain a solution order by order in the dimensional regularisation parameter.},

This has a practical motivation: Through a suitable modular transformation we can achieve that the nome squared is a small quantity, leading to fast numerical evaluations. Contrary to the case of multiple polylogarithms, where it is sufficient to consider just variable transformations for the numerical evaluations of multiple polylogarithms, it is more natural in the elliptic case to consider a combination of a variable transformation (i.e. a modular transformation) together with a redefinition of the master integrals. Thus we combine a coordinate transformation on the base manifold with a basis transformation in the fibre. Only in the combination of the two transformations we stay within the same class of functions. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Author(s)},

The matched filtering technique is an optimal method to dig out the gravitational wave signal that is buried in the strong noise. The matched filtering technique is also essential to estimate the parameters of the gravitational wave source. Matched filtering requires a bank of accurate gravitational waveforms. Nowadays, two LIGO detectors and one Virgo are working. Other laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as KAGRA and the third LIGO in India, IndIGO, are developing. The space-borne detection projects including LISA, Taiji, and TianQin are also in progress. The pulsar timing approach with FAST, SKA, and other radio telescopes to detect gravitational wave is also in the rapid development. It is foreseeable the gravitational wave astronomy in the wide frequency band from 10-9 to 1000 Hz will be realized in the near future. Since the matched filtering plays an important role, the modeling of gravitational wave sources is urgent and important. For realistic objects without any symmetry, the analytical treatment of Einstein equation becomes nearly intractable. The numerical relativity is the most robust and reliable method and tool for solving the Einstein equation. We introduce the research of numerical relativity in the viewpoint of gravitational wave astronomy.},
