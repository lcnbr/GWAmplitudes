The (>>>:pn)  expansion, is a perturbative expansion of (?:efe)  in the orbital regime, which at (?:lo)  reproduces Newtonian gravity.  Consider a system of orbiting bodies with typical values $\bar{M},\bar{R},\bar{v}$ for masses, separations, and velocities. Then, the viral theorem states:

$$
\ang{T}_\tau=-\half \ang{U} \implies \quad \bar{M} \bar{v}^2\sim \frac{G \bar{M}^2}{\bar{R}}
$$ {#eq-virial}

thus we can consider the following equivalent small parameters:

$$
\bar{v}^2\sim \frac{\grav \bar{M}}{\bar{R}}
$$

We therefore expand in both velocities and coupling constant. This can be achieved either by a classical (albeit quite complicated) perturbative treatment [see @Blanchet:2013haa;@Blanchet:1995fg], or a more contemporary (?:eft)-based approach coyly called (?:nrgr) [@Goldberger:2004jt;@Sturani:2021xpq], itself inspired by (?:nrqcd) . We call $n$(?:pm) the expansion carried out to $\order[2n]{v}$. 



Regardless of method, there are a few shortcomings with this expansion. While it is well suited to describe the *motion* of objects in an orbital regime, it is not equally effective at describing gravitational radiation far from the source, as it exhibits divergences for $r\to\infty$^[In HEP speak this is called an infrared divergence]. This means that in the (?:gw)  context, the (?:pn)  expansion is in fact usually coupled to a weak-field approximation (see below), outside the near zone. This is the region surrounding the source, that is of small extent compared to the wavelength of the emitted radiation:

$$
r \ll \lambda
$$ {#eq-nearzone}

The (?:pn)  expansion can also be viewed as an expansion in small 'retardations'. To see this, consider a slowly  moving source, such that the time derivatives of the metric generated by this source will be smaller than the spatial derivatives by a factor $\order{v}$,
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}=\order{v} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i},
$$
or $\partial_0=\order{\epsilon)} \partial_i$. Thus, the d'Alembertian operator, applied to the metric is, to lowest order, a Laplacian operator
$$
-\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}+\nabla^2=\left[1+O\left(\epsilon^2\right)\right] \nabla^2 .
$$

This means that retardation effects, due to the time derivative, are small corrections. In the (?:pn)  expansion we are consequently trying to compute some quantity $F(t-r)$, such as a component of the metric, which is intrinsically a function of the retarded time $t_r=t-r$, from its expansion for small retardation $r$,
$$
F(t_r)=F(t)-{r} \dot{F}(t)+\frac{r^2}{2} \ddot{F}(t)+\ldots
$$

Importantly, the derivatives should bring down factors proportional to frequency $\Omega$ of the emitted radiation. Thus, this is in fact an expansion in $r \Omega\sim r / \lambda$, which is only valid in the near zone as defined by @eq-nearzone, and breaks down outside this zone, in the so-called *radiation zone*. A serious consequence of this fact is that the pure, naive (?:pn)  expansion is unable to account for outgoing or incoming radiation, and thus unable to describe isolated systems. This is where the (?:pm)  expansion comes in.
