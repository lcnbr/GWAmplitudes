Whilst we have almost no hope to detect any (?:gw) scattering events with current experimental apparatuses, the scattering formalism can still be very useful in the quest for orbital waveforms. Most importantly, while experimental data has not been driving *gravitational* scattering theory, the interplay between *particle* scattering experiment and theory have been an enormously fruitful endeavor for the understanding of fundamental interactions in (?:hep). The back and forth between precise measurements (such as those conducted at the (?:lhc) ) and precise predictions for particle scattering, has pushed the boundaries of the calculations possible. It would be therefore very beneficial if one could apply the large knowledge acquired for small non-gravitationally interacting particles, to large compact orbiting bodies. We will see that it is indeed the case.

Such techniques including (?:eft), double copy, generalized unitarity, (?:ibp) reduction, differential equations methods, developed in the context of perturbative computations of collider observables now find an application to the scattering problem in gravity. A key part of applying tools originally developed for quantum systems to problems in gravity is controlling the classical limit, a historically difficult endeavor. Once scattering data is obtained, one needs to extract the relevant observables. This may be in an effort to compare results from the different methods, in which case gauge and diffeomorphism, and Lorentz invariance are key, since different methods make different gauge and frame choices. It can also be to extract the relevant information for detection and data extraction, in which case the (?:gw) waveform is the relevant observable. In the latter case one is mostly interested in the orbital waveform, and thus a map from unbound to bound orbits is necessary. 

Multiple formalisms have arisen to map the scattering problem to an orbital one, and the quantum formalism to a classical one. One key way is to map scattering data to a potential (as present in a Hamiltonian for example). In fact this has been developped as early as the 1970s in [@Hiida:1972xs;@Iwasaki:1971vb]. Further developments happened in [@Neill:2013wsa;@Bjerrum-Bohr:2013bxa;@Vaidya:2014kza;@Cachazo:2017jef;@Guevara:2017csg;@Damour:2016gwp]. Here we will follow the treatment in [Cheung, Rothstein, and Solon @Cheung:2018wkq], where the conservative part of such scattering amplitudes is matched to an (?:eft) and subsequently to mapped to a potential. Recent efforts to add dissipative effects have also been successful [see @Kalin:2022hph]. This potential can then be used as input to the (?:eob) formalism. Furthermore, [Kalin and Porto @Kalin:2019rwq; @Kalin:2019inp], have shown a path forward in directly extending unbound data to bound orbits, obviating the need to use a potential and (?:eob) at all. 

Finally, as mentioned in the last chapter, scattering can stand on its own and still be useful without being extended to the orbital case. The (?:pm) approximation can be computed from scattering amplitudes in an (?:eft) framework [@Kalin:2020mvi]. We can also explore the classical observables possible in scattering scenarios. This has been developed in @Kosower:2018adc and was extended to local observables ^[local as in not time integrated and thus presenting time dependent dynamics] such as waveforms  in @Cristofoli:2021vyo.


In this chapter we will first look at how to use amplitude data to extract orbital and scattering waveforms. We will then look at the (?:kmoc) formalism to directly extract observables. Finally, we will look at how to compute amplitudes, and comparing to results such as those in [@Kosower:2018adc; @Bern:2021xze].

## Scattering amplitudes {#sec-scatamp}     

In (?:qft), to date the only way to encode scattering data is through a scattering amplitude. Consider a process where one starts out with a set of particles described by a state $\ket{i}$, that interact, and yield a final state $\ket{f}$. The scattering amplitude is then defined as the probability amplitude for this process to occur. It is simply given by 
$$\mel{i}{\Smat-1}{f}=(2\pi)^4 \deltafn[(4)]{p_f-p_i}\im \ampl_{fi},$$

where $\Smat$ is the S-matrix, encoding asymptotic time evolution, $\Smat=U_t(-\infty,+\infty)$. We subtract the identity from it, forming what some call the transfer matrix $\Tmat$, as we only are interested in processes where something happens (i.e. not everything stays the same). In the above equation we also define the *scattering matrix element* $\ampl_{fi}$ [see @Srednicki:2007, p. 76] or *invariant Feynman amplitude* [see @Coleman:2018a, p.214], by factoring out a normalized spacetime delta-function that impose the conservation of momentum on the external particles, and a complex unit. The computation of $\ampl$ is made possible by the (?:lsz) [@Lehmann:1954rq;@Collins:2019ozc] formalism, which relates $\ampl_{fi}$ to time-ordered correlation functions (also known as Green's functions) of the given QFT. Green's functions, can be expanded as an infinite sum of diagrams, weighted by a small coupling. The diagrams encode integrals that are obtained by applying Feynman rules which can be readily extracted from an action describing the theory.

## (>:kmoc) framework {#sec-kmoc}

The (>>>:kmoc) framework (@Kosower:2018adc) is very general, and is aimed at taking the classical limit of a scattering event in an unspecified theory. We will apply it later on  to (?:sqed) and gravity. 

### Conventions

First let us define our conventions. Throughout this section we use relativistically natural units, i.e. we do *not* set $\hbar=1$. This will essentially be the small parameter that multiplies the soft momenta that defined the region in @sec-amp2pot. In this section we will further motivate this classical limit in more detail by taking the generally accepted limit that makes quantum physics collapse to classical physics

$$\hbar\to0.$$ 

We still retain $c=1$, meaning that, using dimensional analysis we have that $[L][T]^{-1}=1$ i.e. $[L]=[T]$,  length and time are measured in the same units. Correspondingly, energy is measured in units of mass
$$
\energy=mc^2\implies[\energy]=[m]=[M],
$$ 

and $\hbar$ has the following units

$$
\energy=\hbar \omega\implies [M]=[\hbar][T]^{-1}\implies [\hbar]=[T][M]
.$$ 

Thus, momentum $\emom$ has units of $[\emom]=[M]$ mass and wavenumber $[\bar{\emom}]=[\frac{\emom}{\hbar}]=[T]^{-1}$ has units of inverse time. 
We will denote the Lorentz-invariant phase space measure by $\ddP{p}$^[Repeated integration will be denoted $\ddP[n]{p_1,\dots,p_n}$]:

$$
\int \ddP{p} \dots      = \int \frac{\dd[3]{\tv{p}}}{2\hbar\shellen (2\pi)^3} \dots = \int \dn[4]{p}\nposendelta[-m^2]{p} \dots,
$$

where quantities denoted by bars absorb the relevant factors of $2\pi$, such that $\dn[n]{p}=\frac{\dd[n]p}{(2\pi)^n}$. Additionally, we have defined $\hbar\shellen=\sqrt{\tv{p}^2+m^2}$ to be the on-shell energy and  $\delta^{(+)}$ is the normalized positive energy on-shell delta function:

$$
\nposendelta[-m^2]{p}=(2\pi)\deltafn{\lv{p}^2-m^2}\thetafn{\ct[0]{p}}=\ndeltafn{\lv{p}^2-m^2}\thetafn{\ct[0]{p}}
$$

### Expansions and simplifications

Notice that if we rescale all photon momenta (taking them to be the loop momenta) by $\hbar$ or equivalently take them to be in the soft region: $\abs{k}\sim\abs{q}\ll \abs{p}$, where $p$ is the external momenta, then the photon propagator scales homogeneously in $\hbar$, typically:

$$
\inv{(\ell-\tm)^2}=\inv{\hbar^2}\inv{(\bar{\ell}-\tw)^2},
$$ {#eq-photonscale}

thus contributes $\order[-2]{\hbar}$ to the overall diagram. The matter propagator on the other hand, has inhomogeneous $\hbar$ scaling, as we do not rescale the external momenta, (or equivalently the external momenta are not restricted by the regions). Note that we will not consider internal mass loops as the soft limit means that massive pair production is forbidden, thus massive propagators necessarily route an external momentum. We can nonetheless expand a generic massive propagator in the soft limit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\inv{(\ell-\emom[i])^2-\mass[i]^2}&=\inv{\ell^2-2\ell\cdot\emom[i] +\cancel{\emom[i]^2}-\cancel{\mass[i]^2}}= \inv{\hbar^2\bar{\ell}^2-2\hbar \bar{\ell}\cdot \emom[i]}\\
&=-\inv{\hbar} \inv{2\bar{\ell}\cdot\emom[i]}\pa{1+\hbar\frac{ \bar{\ell}^2}{2\bar{\ell}\cdot\emom[i]}+\hbar^2\frac{ \bar{\ell}^4}{(2\bar{\ell}\cdot\emom[i])^2}+\dots}.\\
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-massiveScale}

In other contexts one may say that the matter propagator has eikonalized (it is now linear in $\ell$). Before we compute the amplitudes let us set up some useful kinematic identities and variables. If we consider the two-to-two particle scattering, taking an all outgoing momentum convention we have the following masses:

$$
 \mass[1]^2=\emom[4]^2 =\emom[1]^2,\quad \mass[2]^2=\emom[2]^2 =\emom[3]^2,
$$ {#eq-masses}

and Mandelstahm variables:

$$
 \mands=(\emom[1]+\emom[2])^2,\quad \mandt=\tm^2=(\emom[1]+\emom[4])^2,\quad \mandu=(\emom[1]+\emom[3])^2   ,
$$

subject to the usual equation:

$$
\mands+\mandt+\mandu=2(\mass[1]^2+\mass[2]^2).
$$

We can also change the external momentum variables to ones more amenable to the soft limit, namely:


$$
\emom[1]=-\pa[\big]{\semom[1]-\Half[\tm]}, \emom[2]=-\pa[\big]{\semom[2]+\Half[\tm]}, \emom[3]=\pa[\big]{\semom[2]-\Half[\tm]}, \emom[4]=\pa[\big]{\semom[1]+\Half[\tm]} .
$$ {#eq-newmom}

The new momentum variables $\semom[i]$ are crucially orthogonal to momentum transfer $\tm$ :^[we use @eq-masses ]

$$
\semom[i]\cdot\tm=0,
$$ {#eq-orthog}


 and the physical scattering region, given by $\mands>(\mass[1]+\mass[2])^2$ and $\tm^2<0$ is the given by the same formulas:

$$
\mands=\pa[\Big]{-\pa[\big]{\semom[1]-\Half[\tm]}-\pa[\big]{\semom[2]+\Half[\tm]}}^2=(\semom[1]+\semom[2])^2
$$

and 

$$
\mandt=\pa[\Big]{-\pa[\big]{\semom[1]-\Half[\tm]}+\semom[1]+\Half[\tm]}^2 = \tm^2.
$$

With all the ingredients in place, we can now go on to compute the amplitudes.

[^measurech]: We changed the integration variable from $r_i$ to $w_i=r_i-\emom[i]$ thus the measure changes:$$\ddP[2+\abs{X}]{r_1,r_2,X}=\ddP[\abs {X}]{r_X}\prod\limits_{i=1,2}\dn[4]{w_i}\ndeltafn{2\emom[i] \cdot w_i+w_i^2}\thetafn{\emom[i]^0+w_i^0}$$ where we used the same reasoning as for the $q_i$ variable change.
    
[^expand]: Here the expansion is in powers of the coupling constant, so even though we want $\hbar$s to cancel, the loop order will still affect the order of the contribution through the coupling constant  $\coupling$  and the (?:lo) corresponds to $\coupling$
[^comp]: Compare to $$\begin{aligned}\dPsb{\tw}&=\dn[4]{\tw} \ndeltafn{2\emom[1]\cdot\tw+\hbar\tw^2}\thetafn{\ct[0]{\emom[1]}+\tm^0}\\& \ndeltafn{2\emom[1]\cdot \tw +\hbar\tw^2}\thetafn{\ct[0]{\emom[2]}+\tm^0}\end{aligned}$$ The theta functions cancel as $\tm^0\to0$ and $\emom[i]$ becomes classical. 




[^shift]: $f(x)=\int \ddP{\emom} \shellft{f}({\emom})\exp{-\frac{\im}{\hbar} \emom^\mu x_\mu}$. Then a shifted, i.e. translated version of $f(x)$ can be written:$$\begin{aligned}f(x-x_0)&=\int \ddP{\emom} \shellft{f}({\emom})\,\exp{-\frac{\im}{\hbar} p_\mu (x^\mu-x_0^\mu)}\\&=\int \ddP{\emom} \shellft{f}({\emom})\,\exp{\frac{\im}{\hbar}p_\mu x^\mu_0}\,\exp{-\frac{\im}{\hbar} p_\mu x^\mu}\end{aligned}$$ Thus the associated, translated state is:$$\ket{f}=\int \ddP{\emom} \shellft{f}({\emom})\,\exp{\frac{\im}{\hbar}p_\mu x^\mu_0}\,\ket{\emom }$$

[^complete]: $1=\sum\limits_X \int \ddP[2+\abs{X}]{r_1,r_2,X}\dyad{r_1 r_2 X}$ Where we could consider the states ${r_1,r_2,X}$ to be the final states after the scattering. Note that we always impose having two (?s:bh), at all times, as we have no pair annihilation, which is why the sum always has a two particle dyad. The additional states encoded in $X$ are all possible additional messenger states (we also have no (?:bh) pair production).

[^measureshift]: Introducing the momentum shifts modifies the measure in the following way:
    $$\begin{aligned}\ddP{\emom[i]'}&=\ddP{\emom[i]+q_i}\\=&\dn[4]{q_i}\,\ndeltafn{{(\emom[i]+q_i)^2-m_i^2}} \thetafn{{\emom[i]^0+q_i^0}}\end{aligned}$$
            Now since we also have the on-shell enforcing delta function from $\ddP{\emom[i]}$ we can rewrite the delta functions:     $$\begin{aligned}\ddP{\emom[i]}&\,\ndeltafn{(\emom[i]+q_i)^2-m_i^2}\\&=\ddP{\emom[i]}\ndeltafn{\underbracket{(\emom[i]^2-m_i^2)}_{\text{redundant}}+2 \emom[i] \cdot q_i+q_i^2}\\&=\ddP{\emom[i]}\ndeltafn{2 \emom[i] \cdot q_i+q_i^2}\end{aligned}$$
            Finally we integrate $q_2$ by solving  $\ndeltafn[(4)]{\emom[1]+\emom[2]-\emom[1]'-\emom[2]'}=\ndeltafn[(4)]{q_1+q_2}$ and thus we just set $q_2=-q_1$

[^constA]: $A$ absorbs the various constants, with $A=\sqrt{2}m\frac{\comptlen}{\wfwidth}$ and $\tv[0]{x}$ 

<!-- [^5]: Here $\tw=\frac{\tm}{\hbar}$ is the wavenumber -->
[^7]:  $[\frac{1}{\sqrt{-\tw^2}}]=[T]=[L]=[\scatlen]$
