# Introduction

The detection of gravitational waves by the (?:ligo)  and Virgo collaborations in 2016 [-@LIGOScientific:2016aoc] has sparked a new era of gravitational wave astronomy. The first detections were of (?:bbh) mergers. More recently, (?:bns)  mergers [-@LIGOScientific:2017vwq]  as well as (?:ns)-(?:bh) mergers have been detected [-@LIGOScientific:2021qlt]. Future detectors will further increase sensitivity and will be able to detect a wide range of astrophysical sources. Studying these gravitational waves signals gives us a very powerful new window into the universe.  It allows us to study the properties of neutron stars and black holes, and the physics of compact object mergers, but also gives us a powerful testing apparatus for general relativity.

To detect these faint signals (?:ligo) and Virgo, have been made to be extraordinarily precise instruments. Thus, they demand correspondingly precise theoretical predictions and models. This is not just for comparisonâ€™s sake, but for detection as well. These faint signals are often buried in the noise of the detector. To counteract this experimental physicists make use of a matched filtering approach, where they try to match the signal to a template. The template is a model of the signal ideally provided by theoretical physicists based on physical theories. The more precise the template, the higher the signal-to-noise ratio, the more probable and precise the detection.

In recent years, an unlikely ally in this precision race has arisen, based on (?:qft) techniques. This is seemingly an impossibility as (?:qft) and (?:gr) have historically been the two irreconcilable theories that 'together' span the whole range of scales in the universe. (?:qft) and the standard model, describe physics at the smallest scales, where quantum effects dominate. This is the physics of colliders, and condensed matter. The standard model is our best guess as to the nature of the fundamental constituents of 'matter' and 'light'. (?:gr) on the other hand describes physics at the largest scales, where gravity dominates. It was developed by Einstein as the successor to the Newtonian theory of gravity, which was not able to account for such orbital mechanics as the precession of the perihelion of mercury. Having passed every experimental test we have thrown at it, (?:gr) is by far the best theory of gravity we have yet. It can describe cosmological phenomena, as well as the compact objects known as black holes.

These two physics leviathans do not get along, however. (?:gr) is a theory of geometry, and (?:qft) is a theory of interactions. We can try to write an interpret one in the language of the other, but in either case difficulties arise. Writing (?:gr) in terms of perturbative (?:qft) one introduces the graviton. However it turns out that such a theory breaks down at high energies, and is un-renormalisable . In fact the presence of black holes, that dominate the high energy spectrum of (?:gr), is a testament to that fact   [@Shomer:2007vq]. On the other hand, whilst one can write (?s:qft) on a curved background, this is does not quantize gravity itself, and therefore does not really adress the problem. Background independent theories such as loop quantum gravity does not as of yet have semiclassical limit collapsoing to (?:gr). String theory, on the other hand, introduces spurious dimensions that need to be compactified, which leads to uncountably many different solutions. In short, there is no satisfactory theory of that combines (?:gr) and (?:qft) in a consistent way. 

Regardless of this fact however, one can still use the powerful tools of ine to tackle problems in the other. Specifically, if one considers the classical limit of (?:qft) for example, one is able to extract perturbative gravitational dynamics from an initially quantum description of the setup. This is interesting because the tools developed for high energy physics have become extremely powerful and efficient theoretical machines, often making use of diagrammatic reasoning. Tools such as Feynman diagrams, differential equations and more recently generalised unitarity, can all be applied to *classical* orbital dynamics in (?:gr). This is exactly the subject of this thesis.

Specifically we are interested in the diagrammatic objects that arise when framing the two body problem similarly to particle collisions. We will explain where these tools shine in the broader context of waveform approaches such as (?:eob) , (?:nrgr) , (?:pm) and (?:pn) approximations. 

The document is organized as follows. In chapter two we deal with the theoretical foundations of gravitational waves, exploring how they come about if one linearizes Einsteins' field equations. The subsequent chapter discusses the experimental apparatuses that are used to detect gravitational waves. We look at the techniques used to extract the signals for the noise, and look at the motivation for precise theoretical predictions. In chapter 3 we look at how to generate partial and full waveforms. We explore the (?:eob) and (?:nr) frameworks. Motivated by the need for more precise ingredients to input into (?:eob) , in chapter 4 we look at the state of the art formalsims that incorporate amplitudes tools into the program. We take a look at the conservative (?:eft) matching approach as well as the  dissipation including (?:kmoc) formalism. This is where we take a deeper look at the amplitude computing tools, and how they apply in this specific application. We close with a discussion of the challenges that lie ahead, and the future of gravitational wave astronomy.
