The matched filtering approach introduced in the previous section motivates the development of tools for generating waveforms. The matched filtering technique is especially sensitive to the phase of the (?:gw) , necessitating precise determination of the waveform template's phase. These templates can be varied in physical content, but also in practicality. In all cases they need to be able to cover the set of parameters (the parameter space) that one is interested in exploring. Clearly, if the waveform has been generated purely heuristically, then the physical content of the detection is close to zero. From this approach, one can only deduce that a phenomenon producing a similar waveform was detected, but not much more. However, if the input parameters are physically meaningful, e.g. the mass ratio of a binary compact inspiraling system, then the waveform constructed purely from this input, if matched to the signal, tells us that a compact binary inspiraling system with this mass ratio has been detected. This is called parameter estimation, and is key to maximizing the physics output of a detection. 

Crucially, the waveform generation must be able to cover the whole parameter space (for example all feasible mass ratios) to be useful, as one does *not* know in advance the parameters describing the system to be identified.  Ideally waveform generation should be done in a way that is computationally efficient, as the number of parameters as well as their range to explore is large. In the end, waveform generation is currently performed in a hybrid way: some waveforms for specific parameter space points, are generated from first principles, while the rest of the parameter space waveforms are interpolated. 

In this chapter we will describe the first-principles waveform generation tools currently being developed. More specifically we will explore techniques for compact binary waveforms. In this context waveforms may describe  inspiralling or scattering binaries. Currently, only the inspiralling binaries have been detected, as these are the systems whose signal (?:ligo) and other detectors are most sensitive to (see @sec-ligo), other than being by far the most common emitters of high-intensity (?s:gw). As discussed in @sec-compactbinaries, orbiting and (?:gw)  emitting compact objects will necessarily inspiral and merge at some point. 

For such inspiraling binaries, the waveform features 3 distinct phases shown in : a first *inspiral phase*, a *merger phase* where a remnant compact body is produced as a result of the coalescence of the two objects, and a postmerger, or *ringdown phase*, where the remnant still emits gravitational radiation while settling to its new stable configuration. Each phase is characterized by different dynamical properties of the orbiting bodies and thus different frameworks are aimed at describing the corresponding features of the waveforms. Even the description of one phase involves different regimes, and thus more specific framework, additionally dependent on the type/initial state of the two orbiting bodies.

There is also hope to detect scattering binaries as argued in @Mukherjee:2020hnm, but they are currently mainly used as a testbed for new theories making use of particle physics knowledge. Additionally, one might be able to extend their validity to inspiraling binaries [see @Kalin:2019rwq]. 



Most of these techniques have two important parts. The first consists in the precise modelling of the evolution of the emitting system. In most cases, this boils down to obtaining the (?s:eom) for the interacting bodies. For scattering, this can just be the amplitude of the event. The second part is extracting the variation of the metric due to the source movement at the measurement point, far away from the source, i.e., the waveform. Of course, the metric at the source is tightly coupled to the dynamics of the system, and thus the approximations conducted at the source also effects the way one extracts the waveform. 

The only full, first-principles waveform techniques are (?:nr)  and (?:eob) ^[There are a whole family of phenomenological frameworks that we will not discuss]. (?:nr)  is quite unique when compared to other methods. Let us look at it before proceeding to (?:eob)  and all the inspiral waveform techniques. 

## (>>:nr) 

The most precise, first-principles waveform-generation technique to date is numerical relativity ((>>>:nr)). It was developed as early as the 1960s [@hahn:1964]. Initially and until relatively recently, these numerical methods were unusable because of numerical instabilities. The idea, however, is simple: the (?:efe)  are a system of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) (albeit nonlinear) that can be solved numerically by discretizing the metric. The causes of instability is three-fold. First, the aforementioned non-linearities make the discretization particularly sensitive to extreme variations, such as those close to a (?:bh), which means that one needs a fine mesh to control error buildup. Second, the gauge freedom establishes limits on the type of discretization procedures, so that spurious modes are not introduced. Third, for (?s:bh) one needs to consider what to do about the physical metric singularity, as infinity is not a number one can plug into a computer! On top of stability problems, when compact binary objects are considered, the scales involved further complicate things, as one needs enough resolution to resolve the objects, and the deformations on the metric, as well as a large enough volume to have reasonable orbits. This requires a huge amount of lattice nodes, meaning such simulations (even if stable) are extremely computationally expensive.

In 2005 [Pretorious @Pretorius:2005gq] and a little later [Campanelli et al. @Campanelli:2005dd] made a breakthrough advance and were able to fully compute an inspiral-merger-ringdown sequence for a (?:bbh) . Pretorius made use of two techniques: (?:amr)  and the (?:gh)  formalism. (?:amr) , like its name suggests, is a technique based on a dynamical discretization procedure . The (?:gh)  formalism, tackles the singularity problem validating the excision of the black hole, and crucially letting that region move. The combination of the procedures, were able to finally slay the proverbial numerical dragon. 

These waveforms, such as the one in @fig-pretwave, confirmed the predictions made in [Buonanno and Damour @Buonanno:2000ef] that the merger phase of a (?:bbh)  would not be as complicated as previously thought. As numerical techniques evolved further, they were able to elucidate more and more complex behaviors.

Nowadays, it is the gold standard of waveform generation. Of course, it remains incredibly computationally expensive ^[A single waveform with 10 orbits can take a week and tens of thousands of CPU hours] and making any sizable bank of purely (?:nr) waveforms is seen as a fools endeavor. To date, only a couple hundred parameter space points have been simulated. Consequently, (?:nr)  is used to complement, calibrate and extend the other waveform generation techniques. For example to detect the first signals (?:ligo) and other detectors interpolated between (?:nr)-generated parameter space points to reach the ones needed for detection. However, with the advent of (?:lisa) on the horizon, a further problem will arise. (?:nr)  results by nature only take into account the last few orbit cycles before merger. Any more than that and computational time becomes prohibitive. (?:lisa), with its low noise floor, should be able to detect inspiraling but not yet merging binaries. Doing so will require waveform templates with hundreds of orbits, well out of reach of any modern (?:nr)  package. Nonetheless, this technique has shown and will continue to show its worth, as no approximations other than discretization are made. The physical content of such waveforms is thus high. 

## Inspiral methods

Before continuing to the (?:eob)  method, let us look at the techniques that focus on the inspiral part of the waveform. There are broadly speaking three methods that fall in this category. The first we have already encountered at 1st order: (?:pn) . It is a perturbative expansion in both relative velocity (slow moving limit) and the coupling constant $\grav$ (weak field limit) of the (?:efe) . The second is the (?:pm)  method, which is a perturbative expansion in *only* the coupling constant $\grav$. At face value the (?:pm)  method contains the (?:pn)  one as a special case, however as at zeroth order, the (?:pm)  approximation captures straight line motion, and is generally more expressive of scattering. The final approximation can be applied when the mass ratio of the object in question is large. Here one can expand around a fixed but *non-flat* metric, essentially considering one of the objects as a test-particle evolving on a background caused by the heavier object. This is called the (?:gsf) formalism.
